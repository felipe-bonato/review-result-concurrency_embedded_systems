  abstract={Several consensus algorithms have been proposed as a way of resolving the Byzantine General problem with respect to blockchain consensus process. However, when these consensus algorithms are applied to a distributed, asynchronous network, some suffer with security and/or scalability issues, while others suffer with liveness and/or safety issues. This is because the majority of research have not considered the importance of liveness and safety, with respect to the integrity of the consensus decision. In this paper, a novel solution to this challenge is presented, a solution that protects blockchain transactions from fraudulent or erroneous mis-spends. This consensus protocol uses a combination of probabilistic randomness, an isomorphic balance authentication, error detection and synchronised time restrictions, when assessing the authenticity and validity of IoT request. Designed to operate in a distributed asynchronous network, this approach increases scalability while maintaining a high transactional throughput, even when faced with Byzantine failure. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={This paper quantifies the coverage area of Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN) for Packet Success Rates (PSR) above 85%, where acceptable Quality of Service (QoS) can be achieved. The network consists of battery-operated end-nodes (ENs) and multiple stationary gateways (GWs). We consider asynchronous communication that uses ALOHA-based random channel access. Each transmission from the ENs can be received by multiple GWs. Such spatial diversity results in favorable Signal-to-Noise ratios (SNR). The LoRa modulation is assumed and its specific features, such as IQ inversion, further contribute to decreasing the impact of interference. An increase in the GW density improves network performance, which allows support for a larger density of end-nodes as well as increasing the coverage area. Our simulation results show that a suburban area of up to 1.44 km2 can be covered with five GWs with up to fifty end-nodes with a PSR greater than 86%. © 2022 by the authors.},

  abstract={Ensuring the correctness of distributed cyber-physical systems can be done at runtime by monitoring properties over their behaviour. In a decentralised setting, such behaviour consists of multiple local traces, each offering an incomplete view of the system events to the local monitors, as opposed to the standard centralised setting with a unique global trace. We introduce the first monitoring framework for timed properties described by timed regular expressions over a distributed network of monitors. First, we define functions to rewrite expressions according to partial knowledge for both the centralised and decentralised cases. Then, we define decentralised algorithms for monitors to evaluate properties using these functions, as well as proofs of soundness and eventual completeness of said algorithms. Finally, we implement and evaluate our framework on synthetic timed regular expressions, giving insights on the cost of the centralised and decentralised settings and when to best use each of them. © Victor Roussanaly and Yliès Falcone.},

  abstract={Distributed energy resources (DERs), such as responsive loads and energy storage systems, can help grid operators to more effectively balance supply and demand and manage network constraints. However, consumer acceptance of load coordination schemes depends on ensuring customer quality of service (QoS), thus requiring the careful management of device-level constraints. Simultaneously managing both device-level and system-level objectives is a difficult problem. Most potential solutions to the DER coordination problem are in some way distributed, with decision logic running both at the device (such as a thermostat) and the coordinator, with potentially complex communications between devices and one or more coordinators. It is difficult to effectively test distributed DER control schemes, particularly when there are thousands of devices with both device-level and grid-level constraints and asynchronous communications. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting a novel real-time grid-and-DER cyber-physical co-simulation platform for testing advanced DER coordination schemes and characterizing the behaviors of a DER fleet. The co-simulation platform is particularly suitable for: i) testing the real-time performance of a large fleet of DERs delivering advanced grid services; ii) characterizing the distribution of states for a large fleet of managed DERs; and iii) incorporating practical limitations of DERs and communications and analyzing the effects on fleet-wide performance. To illustrate these benefits, we demonstrate how the platform can be used to test a fleet with thousands of DERs coordinated using Packetized Energy Management (PEM) and interacting with a realistic transmission system model. © 2010-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={In the Internet-of-Things (IoT) vision, everyday objects evolve into cyber-physical systems. The massive use and deployment of these systems has given place to the Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT (IIoT). Due to its scalability requirements, IIoT architectures are typically distributed and asynchronous. In this scenario, one of the most widely used paradigms is publish/subscribe, where messages are sent and received based on a set of categories or topics. However, these architectures face interoperability challenges. Consistency in message categories and structure is the key to avoid potential losses of information. Ensuring this consistency requires complex data processing logic both on the publisher and the subscriber sides. In this paper, we present our proposal relying on AsyncAPI to automate the design and implementation of these asynchronous architectures using model-driven techniques for the generation of (part of) message-driven infrastructures. Our proposal offers two different ways of designing the architectures: either graphically, by modeling and annotating the messages that are sent among the different IoT devices, or textually, by implementing an editor compliant with the AsyncAPI specification. We have evaluated our proposal by conducting a set of experiments with 25 subjects with different expertise and background. The experiments show that one-third of the subjects were able to design and implement a working architecture in less than an hour without previous knowledge of our proposal, and an additional one-third estimated that they would only need less than two hours in total. © 2021, The Author(s).},

  abstract={As the number of sensors connected to the IoT cloud platform increases, the incoming data continues to increase, and the server may crash due to excessive traffic. In order to solve this problem and ensure the accuracy of the data received by the server, this paper designs a message middleware based on Netty. Message middleware is widely used in many systems, using message queues to achieve asynchronous communication and traffic peak reduction, and solve the problem of high data concurrency. Compare the mainstream messaging middlewares, select ActiveMQ middleware, design the consumer model according to the characteristics of the protocol, and perform idempotence processing on the consumer side to improve the reliability and security of the middleware. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

  abstract={Many collective adaptive systems consist of distributed nodes that communicate with each other and with their physical environments, but that logically should operate in a synchronous way. HybridSynchAADL is a recent modeling language and formal analysis tool for such virtually synchronous cyber-physical systems (CPSs). HybridSynchAADL uses the Hybrid PALS equivalence to reduce the hard problem of designing and verifying virtually synchronous CPSs—with network delays, asynchronous communication, imprecise local clocks, continuous dynamics, etc.—to the much easier tasks of designing and verifying their underlying synchronous designs. Up to now HybridSynchAADL has lacked important programming language features, such as compound data types and user-defined functions, which made it difficult to model advanced control logics of collective adaptive systems. In this paper, we extend the HybridSynchAADL language, its formal semantics, and its analysis tool to support these programming language features. We apply our extension of HybridSynchAADL to design and analyze a collection of collaborating autonomous drones that adapt to their environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things faces a significant scaling issue due to the rapid growth of the number of devices and asynchronous communications. Different technologies in the license-free industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band have been widely deployed to fill this gap. LoRa and Sigfox are the most common. Many devices can use the ISM band if they obey the regulations and cope with internal and external interference. However, when there is massive connectivity, the effect of the inter and intra-network interference between multiple networks is significant. This study uses a deep learning-based technique to decode signals and deal with the interference in the uplink of a LoRa network. Two classification-based symbol detection methods are proposed using a deep feedforward neural net-work (DFNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed receivers can decode the signals of a selected user when many LoRa users transmit simultaneously using the same spreading factor over the same frequency band (intra-spreading factor interference), and multiple Sigfox users interfere (inter-network interference). Simulation results show that both receivers outperform the conventional LoRa receiver in the presence of interference. For a target symbol error rate (SER) of 10-3, the proposed DFNN and CNN-based receivers attain around 2 dB and 3.5 dB gain, respectively. © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={A network of observers is considered, where through asynchronous (with bounded delay) communications, they cooperatively estimate the states of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. In such a setting, a new type of adversary might affect the observation process by impersonating the identity of the regular node, which is a violation of communication authenticity. These adversaries also inherit the capabilities of Byzantine nodes, making them more powerful threats called smart spoofers. We show how asynchronous networks are vulnerable to smart spoofing attack. In the estimation scheme considered in this paper, information flows from the sets of source nodes, which can detect a portion of the state variables each, to the other follower nodes. The regular nodes, to avoid being misguided by the threats, distributively filter the extreme values received from the nodes in their neighborhood. Topological conditions based on strong robustness are proposed to guarantee the convergence. Two simulation scenarios are provided to verify the results. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to South China University of Technology and Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract={Location and orientation information is essential for many applications in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we propose a single-anchor scheme for location and orientation estimation of asynchronous cooperative IoT, where only the agents need to in turn broadcast their measurement signals and no round trip communications are required between agents and the anchor. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) is derived for the location, orientation and clock offset parameters based on the received signals. The FIM can be divided into those obtained from time delays and angles, then the Cramér-Rao lower bound is obtained for the parameters of interest. Numerical results illustrate that cooperation between agents can achieve significant performance gain and the proposed single-anchor scheme can be a potential solution for joint location and orientation estimation of asynchronous IoT. © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={Consensus is a basic building block in distributed systems for a myriad of related problems that involve agreement. For asynchronous networks, consensus has been proven impossible, and is well known as Augean task. Failure Detectors (FDs) have since emerged as a possible remedy, able to solve consensus in asynchronous systems under certain assumptions. With the increasing use of asynchronous, wireless Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, such as IEEE 802.15.4/6LoWPAN, the demand of applications that require some form of reliability and agreement is on the rise. What was missing so far is an FD that can operate under the tight constraints offered by Low Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) without compromising the efficiency of the network. We present 6LoFD, an FD specifically aimed at energy and memory efficient operation in small scale, unreliable networks, and evaluate its working principles by using an ns-3 implementation of 6LoFD. © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={Leakage of long-term secrets is a major concern when cryptographic schemes are implemented on devices with weak protection capability, especially for resource-constrained IoT devices. Forward secrecy is a means to minimize the damage when such an event takes place. For pub-/sub-based IoT systems, several end-to-end (from publisher to subscriber) encrypted message transmission schemes have been proposed to tackle the confidentiality problems brought by malicious message brokers. But none of them provide forward secrecy. This article presents FSEE, a forward secure end-to-end encrypted message transmission system for pub-/sub-based IoT. To support FSEE, we design a novel group key exchange protocol BA-GKE, which relies on a semi-trusted key exchange server to provide forward secrecy and support asynchronous communication between group members. We prove its forward secrecy by ProVerif. The core idea of FSEE is to establish a forward secure symmetric key per device using BA-GKE asynchronously, and this device-specific key is shared with the device and its authorized subscribers for encrypting messages securely. By adding a semi-trusted key exchange server to realize BA-GKE in the current IoT architecture, FSEE does not need to change the existing message broker and could be deployed incrementally. The experimental results show that FSEE has comparable performance to existing prominent research and provides higher security. © 2022 Li Cui et al.},

  abstract={The greater availability and accessibility of IoT sensors, data acquisition systems and computer networks, led to the development of distributed control strategies aimed at monitoring and securing of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). In this paper, we propose a distributed asynchronous algorithm for the Secure State Reconstruction (SSR) which relies on a gossip-based procedure to let a network of agents reach a shared estimate of the process state based on measurements taken by the different agents at different time instants. In particular, the procedure aims to reduce measurement noise and provide resilience in the event of cyber attacks that modify the readings of agents or cause their disconnection, combined with the possibility of providing new virtual measurements in realtime. In addition, the gossip-based pair connection is randomly established and subsequently destroyed, making it difficult for an attacker to intercept the information exchange. In detail, we first analytically demonstrate the convergence and correctness of the proposed algorithm, and then we provide a simulation campaign to demonstrate its effectiveness. © 2022 IEEE.},

  abstract={Ubiquitous multi-core processors with a significant increase in computing power resulted in an omnipresent expansion of concurrent server applications. However, modern multithreaded applications exposed a substantial number of efficiency-related challenges. Consequently, lightweight structured concurrency constructs emerged in various multithreaded applications, as the traditional heavyweight threads model is expensive in regards to memory due to its high dependency on OS kernel threads. Modern programming languages such as Kotlin and Java are both built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and are commonly used in mobile application development and server-side applications, offering, by default, the traditional threads approach. However, Kotlin also includes support for a lightweight concurrency model with coroutines, while Java's virtual threads, announced in the OpenJDK's Project Loom, are still experimental. Such contemporary concurrency implementations are primarily enabling an increase in application performance and efficiency. This paper presents an overview of different approaches to structured concurrency and explores their implementation in programming languages Java and Kotlin. It provides a comparative analysis of traditional threads with coroutines in Kotlin and virtual threads in Java. Based on the conducted testing using benchmarks, we analyzed their performance, described implementation differences, and explored their utilization possibilities and adaptation to real-world use-case scenarios. © 2022 Croatian Society MIPRO.},

  abstract={Large-scale decentralized systems of autonomous agents interacting via asynchronous communication often experience the following self-healing dilemma: fault detection inherits network uncertainties making a remote faulty process indistinguishable from a slow process. In the case of a slow process without fault, fault correction is undesirable as it can trigger new faults that could be prevented with fault tolerance that is a more proactive system maintenance. But in the case of an actual faulty process, fault tolerance alone without eventually correcting persistent faults can make systems underperforming. Measuring, understanding and resolving such self-healing dilemmas is a timely challenge and critical requirement given the rise of distributed ledgers, edge computing, the Internet of Things in several energy, transport and health applications. This paper contributes a novel and general-purpose modeling of fault scenarios during system runtime. They are used to accurately measure and predict inconsistencies generated by the undesirable outcomes of fault correction and fault tolerance as the means to improve self-healing of large-scale decentralized systems at the design phase. A rigorous experimental methodology is designed that evaluates 696 experimental settings of different fault scales, fault profiles and fault detection thresholds in a prototyped decentralized network of 3000 nodes. Almost 9 million measurements of inconsistencies were collected in a network, where each node monitors the health status of another node, while both can defect. The prediction performance of the modeled fault scenarios is validated in a challenging application scenario of decentralized and dynamic in-network data aggregation using real-world data from a Smart Grid pilot project. Findings confirm the origin of inconsistencies at design phase and provide new insights how to tune self-healing at an early stage. Strikingly, the aggregation accuracy is well predicted as shown by high correlations and low root mean square errors. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={The increasing popularity and widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) technologies have produced a significant need for the integration of cloud and edge computing with distributed detection solutions to handle the growing volume of distributed security threats. While deep learning-based approaches have been used to detect anomalous behaviors in complex data patterns, the heterogeneity in IoT networks still poses paramount challenges to update synchronization across learning nodes in distributed training. Particularly, the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data patterns over remote nodes significantly affect the performance of model training provisioned on cloud and edge computing servers, and most existing works have assumed a homogeneous setting. The heterogeneity brings the gradient delay problem, causing the gradient inconsistency in the barrier-free asynchronous mode. In this paper, we propose a Delay Compensated Adam (DC-Adam) approach, an asynchronous federated learning-based detection approach, for IoT devices with limited resources. To overcome the notorious gradient delay problem, we develop a Taylor Expansion-based scheme to compensate for the inconsistency caused by asynchronous communication. Moreover, a pre-shared data training strategy for non-IID data is developed to avoid the convergence divergence under the non-IID patterns. After the collaborative model training procedure, we append an additional local training process at each client to fit respective patterns. Via a combination of theoretical analysis of convergence and practical experimental results, we validate the efficacy of our proposed approach compared to the other state-of-the-art approaches. Compared with benchmark approaches, we demonstrate that our proposed method can converge stably, and that it outperforms the barrier-free asynchronous federated learning by 12.8% (accuracy), 14% (precision). 8.71% (recall), and 11.16% (F1 score) on average. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract={Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) receives significant interest due to its rapid development. But IoT applications still face two challenges: heterogeneity and large scale of IoT data. Therefore, how to efficiently integrate and process these complicated data becomes an essential problem. In this article, we focus on the problem that analyzing variable dependencies of data collected from different edge devices in the IoT network. Because data from different devices are heterogeneous and the variable dependencies can be characterized into a graphical model, we can focus on the problem that jointly estimating multiple, high-dimensional, and sparse Gaussian Graphical Models for many related tasks (edge devices). This is an important goal in many fields. Many IoT networks have collected massive multi-task data and require the analysis of heterogeneous data in many scenarios. Past works on the joint estimation are non-distributed and involve computationally expensive and complex non-smooth optimizations. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach: Multi-FST. Multi-FST can be efficiently implemented on a cloud-server-based IoT network. The cloud server has a low computational load and IoT devices use asynchronous communication with the server, leading to efficiency. Multi-FST shows significant improvement, over baselines, when tested on various datasets. © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.},

  abstract={With the emergence of the Internet of Things that allows communications and local computations and with the vision of Industry 4.0, a foreseeable transition is from centralized system planning and operation toward decentralization with interacting components and subsystems, e.g., self-optimizing factories. In this article, a new 'price-based' decomposition and coordination methodology is developed to efficiently coordinate a system consisting of distributed subsystems such as machines and parts, which are described by mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations, in an asynchronous way. The novel method is a dual approach, whereby the coordination is performed by updating Lagrangian multipliers based on economic principles of 'supply and demand.' To ensure low communication requirements within the method, exchanges between the 'coordinator' and subsystems are limited to 'prices' (Lagrangian multipliers) broadcast by the coordinator and to subsystem solutions sent at the coordinator. Asynchronous coordination, however, may lead to convergence difficulties since the order in which subsystem solutions arrive at the coordinator is not predefined as a result of uncertainties in communication and solving times. Under realistic assumptions of finite communication and solve times, the convergence of our method is proven by innovatively extending the Lyapunov stability theory. Numerical testing of generalized assignment problems through simulation demonstrates that the method converges fast and provides near-optimal results, paving the way for self-optimizing factories in the future. Accompanying CPLEX codes and data are included.

  abstract={Modern field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have recently powered high-profile efficiency gains in systems from datacenters to embedded devices by offering ensembles of heterogeneous, reconfigurable hardware units. Programming stacks for FPGAs, however, are stuck in the past-they are based on traditional hardware languages, which were appropriate when FPGAs were simple, homogeneous fabrics of basic programmable primitives. We describe Reticle, a new low-level abstraction for FPGA programming that, unlike existing languages, explicitly represents the special-purpose units available on a particular FPGA device. Reticle has two levels: a portable intermediate language and a target-specific assembly language. We show how to use a standard instruction selection approach to lower intermediate programs to assembly programs, which can be both faster and more effective than the complex metaheuristics that existing FPGA toolchains use. We use Reticle to implement linear algebra operators and coroutines and find that Reticle compilation runs up to 100 times faster than current approaches while producing comparable or better run-time and utilization. © 2021 ACM.},

  abstract={A substantial part of the research on wireless sensor networks is focused on the optimization of the energy consumption through either hardware or protocol communication stacks. Wake-up Receivers (WuRs) represent a new paradigm that offers both ultra low power consumption and low latency through asynchronous communications. However, WuRs have a low sensitivity and thus can misinterpret the received signal inducing a performance degradation of the whole communicating system. To tackle this issue, low power channel coding techniques can be used and we propose in this work to apply Hamming coding and Minimum Energy Coding (ME) to enhance WuR range. A performance study of these two types of coding shows that ME coding outperforms Hamming code in reducing both bit error rate and energy consumption. At a range of 28 m, ME coding saves about 3 times the energy at a bit error rate of 10-3 compared to uncoded scheme. Furthermore, experimentation on the missed wake-ups when applying ME coding was done, showing a gain of 22% in reliability compared to uncoded scheme. © 2021 IEEE.},

  abstract={Component-based software engineering is appealing for industrial embedded systems design for two main reasons: these systems benefit from a strong legacy from previous iterations of the design reducing overall costs and time; and they target platform-independent development to minimize hardware dependent costs. However, such approaches are not yet developed for asynchronous algorithms, limiting the possibilities and performances of code generation. In this paper we propose a framework to describe, simulate, and test asynchronous processing algorithms via a Model Based Design (MBD) approach implemented in MathWorks Simulink. Our approach also facilitates code generation for such algorithms. We demonstrate our approach by designing and validating in simulation a reference architecture for electrical measurement and protection applications. © 2021 IEEE.},

  abstract={In today's era, large data centers are drawn toward the two popular technologies, i.e., enterprise integration patterns (EIP) and software defined networking (SDN). The former is the combination of design patterns which integrates the new and existing business applications in an enterprise environment, whereas the latter is a rapidly evolving networking paradigm that has reshaped the large enterprise network management by introducing the programmable planes and centralized control. The promising features of EIP, i.e., asynchronous communication, reliability and that of SDN, namely, robustness, network programmability, agility, and global visibility can be merged in order to cope with growing network demands and security. In this article, we propose a communication framework that incorporates both EIP and SDN in an enterprise environment. The architecture of the propose communication framework consists of adaptive virtual local area network (VLAN) module to install and delete VLANs reactively using EIP. Furthermore, to enable communication between applications from different networks in an enterprise environment, this framework also contains a packet forwarding module where hosts IP addresses are concealed from each other. In the end, we demonstrate through simulations that how the proposed integrated design can be helpful in improving the security, efficiency, and reliability aspects of the enterprise network. As proof of concept, we also discuss the deployment of our proposed framework in IoT-based Smart Cities, which is the extension of EIP on a large scale. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract={We present a new FIFO (first-in first-out) architecture for both synchronous and asynchronous communication for high-speed and low-power operation. Our FIFO design is reconfigurable and scalable using a separate datapath with an 8T-Cell SRAM and control circuits, which enables specialization for different application requirements. The datapath uses a two-phase clock system of nonoverlapping signals such that one signal increments the address pointer, while the other signal activates the memory decoder for data reading and writing. This structure halves the critical path delay and simplifies the timing operations between the memory decoder and address pointer while maintaining robustness against process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. Our design uses two alternative control circuits to manage separate synchronous and asynchronous operations by generating nonoverlapping control signals that drive the datapath circuit. The empty-full flag circuitry records only the state of the address pointers' rollover independent of the memory size, and, thus, improves scalability and reconfigurability. Compared to prior works, our design is 5X faster with a 2.3X lower power consumption and has a throughput of 1 Giga-Word/s. For a 64-bit word size with a free latency cycle. Additionally, our design functions clocklessly with the synthesizable structure for asynchronous communication that leverages Internet of Things (IoT) and Networks on Chip (NoCs) applications. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract={The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a standard communication protocol for resource-constrained devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). Many IoT deployments require proxies to support asynchronous communication between edge devices and the back-end. This allows (non-trusted) proxies to access sensitive parts of CoAP messages. Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) is a recent standard protocol that provides end-to-end security for CoAP messages at the application layer. Unlike the commonly used standard Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), OSCORE efficiently provides selective integrity protection and encryption on different parts of CoAP messages. Thus, OSCORE enables end-to-end security through intermediary (non-trusted) proxies, while still allowing them to perform their expected services, with considerable security and privacy improvements. To assess whether these security features consume too much of the limited resources available on a constrained device, we have implemented OSCORE (the implementation is available as open-source), and evaluated its efficiency. This paper provides a comprehensive, comparative and experimental performance evaluation of OSCORE on real resource-constrained IoT devices, using the operating system Contiki-NG as IoT software platform. In particular, we experimentally evaluated the efficiency of our OSCORE implementation on resource-constrained devices running Contiki-NG, in comparison with the DTLS implementation TinyDTLS maintained by the Eclipse Foundation. The evaluation results show that our OSCORE implementation displays moderately better performance than TinyDTLS, in terms of per-message network overhead, memory usage, message round-trip time and energy efficiency, thus providing the security improvements of OSCORE with no additional performance penalty. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract={NASA’s human spaceflight efforts are moving towards long-duration exploration missions requiring asynchronous communication between onboard crew and an increasingly remote ground support. In current missions aboard the International Space Station, there is a near real-time communication loop between Mission Control Center and astronauts. This communication is essential today to support operations, maintenance, and science requirements onboard, without which many tasks would no longer be feasible. As NASA takes the next leap into a new era of human space exploration, new methods and tools compensating for the lack of continuous, real-time communication must be explored. The Human-Computer Interaction Group at NASA Ames Research Center has been investigating emerging technologies and their applicability to increase crew autonomy in missions beyond low Earth orbit. Interactions using augmented reality and the Internet of Things have been researched as possibilities to facilitate usability within procedure execution operations. This paper outlines four research efforts that included technology demonstrations and usability studies with prototype procedure tools implementing emerging technologies. The studies address habitat feedback integration, analogous procedure testing, task completion management, and crew training. Through these technology demonstrations and usability studies, we find that low-to medium-fidelity prototypes, evaluated early in the design process, are both effective for garnering stakeholder buy-in and developing requirements for future systems. In this paper, we present the findings of the usability studies for each project and discuss ways in which these emerging technologies can be integrated into future human spaceflight operations. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract={MQTT, AMQP and HTTP are messaging protocols that are commonly used for communicating with resource-constrained IoT devices. HTTP is the standard reference protocol for the REST transportation based on the request/response model, whereas both AMQP and MQTT are message-oriented protocols that use the publish/subscribe model. Message-oriented protocols enhance some of the shortcomings of the complex HTTP protocol by using asynchronous communication, changing the design from a document-centric to a data-centric approach and decreasing the header and message sizes. Although significant technical detail is present on these protocols, their real-time performance is insufficiently elaborated. In this paper, we present an experimental evaluation of these protocols conducted in a homogeneous IoT testbed using a real-time Smart City public data set. We provide the behavioral differences between messaging-based protocols and the REST-based HTTP protocol in terms of message latency and CPU usage for varying traffic loads and message sizes. The results showed that MQTT and AMQP are four times faster than HTTP protocol when comparing the message sent latencies. HTTP uses four times more CPU than the AMQP and MQTT protocols. In summary, message-oriented protocols give more stable and improved results as compared to the REST model-based HTTP protocol for all evaluation scenarios. © 2021 IEEE},

  abstract={With the rapid elevation of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the traditional cloud analytics-based approach is not suitable for a long time and secure health monitoring and lacks online learning capability. The privacy issues of the acquired health data of the subjects have also arisen much concern in the cloud analytics approach. To establish a proof-of-concept, we have considered a critical use-case of cardiac activity monitoring by detecting arrhythmia from analyzing Electrocardiogram (ECG). We have investigated two Federated Learning (FL) architectures for arrhythmia classification utilizing the private ECG data acquired within each smart logic-in-sensor, deployed at the Ultra-Edge Nodes (UENs). The envisioned paradigm allows privacy-preservation as well as the ability to accomplish online knowledge sharing by performing localized and distributed learning in a lightweight manner. Our proposed federated learning architecture for ECG analysis is further customized by asynchronously updating the shallow and deep model parameters of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based lightweight AI model to minimize valuable communication bandwidth consumption. The performance and generalization abilities of the proposed system are assessed by considering multiple heartbeats classes, employing four different publicly available datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous federated learning (Async-FL) approach can achieve encouraging classification efficiency while also ensuring privacy, adaptability to different subjects, and minimizing the network bandwidth consumption. © 2021 IEEE.},

  abstract={Ultra-wide band is one of the most promising localization technologies already and increasingly used in industrial environments. It is also starting to be included in many Internet of Things and mobile devices. The most attractive feature of ultra-wide band for localization and positioning is the achievable centimeter-accuracy that can enable a highly secure spoofing-protected application. On the other hand, the main drawback that still limits its use in battery-operated devices is the high power consumption, especially in idle listening. Today most common approaches use duty cycling, which reduces the overall power consumption at the cost of increased latency. The paper presents a hardware wake-up radio with addressing capability for ultra-wide band communication and ranging. Moreover, the paper introduces a novel protocol that enables the generation of wake-up signals directly with any existing ultra-wide band transceiver, without the requirement of a different radio. The proposed solution achieves -48 dBm of sensitivity with only 100 μW of power consumption. The proposed system enables full asynchronous communication, achieving millisecond latency and always-on capability. Experimental evaluation with a popular commercial transceiver produced by Decawave demonstrates the high energy saving and the effectiveness of the proposed addressing protocol by reducing energy consumption in the order of 100x compared to conventional receivers. © 2021 IEEE.},

  abstract={According to the growing complexity of tasks, which embedded systems should solve, there arises a need to use Real-Time Operation Systems (RTOS). However, RTOS usage and implementation require a set of restrictions for a system, especially on the memory usage and time delays occurrence. The available implementations of coroutines neither cross-platform solutions nor accessible without a third-party library. The article proposes a model of cross-platform coroutine usage from C + + 20 for embedded systems programming and lightweight cooperative multitasking implementation. The proposed model contains the improved minimal scheduler without priorities mechanism and tasks descriptors. The model of coroutines usage for resource-constrained systems is developed. The task inside the model is presented as a coroutine, which can communicate with available coroutines, call them, or be suspended. Also, the minimal primitives of coroutines usage for cooperative multitasking, architecture decisions, and non-blocking data transmission were implemented. For the experimental research, the following list of program components was implemented in the proposed model: cooperative coroutines scheduler, tasks for data transmission, and awaitable type prototypes. The testing and analysis were completed on the chosen microcontroller (MCU). The perspective of coroutines usage on resource-constrained systems was shown in the research based on obtained results of FLASH and RAM consumption. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Coroutine-based concurrency is better suited than multi-threading on microcontrollers with limited computing resources. Using higher interpreted language and a robust cooperative model will help.

  abstract={Industry 4.0 focuses on continuous interconnection services, allowing for the continuous and uninterrupted exchange of signals or information between related parties. The application of messaging protocols for transferring data to remote locations must meet specific specifications such as asynchronous communication, compact messaging, operating in conditions of unstable connection of the transmission line of data, limited network bandwidth operation, support multilevel Quality of Service (QoS), and easy integration of new devices. The Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol is used in software applications that require asynchronous communication. It is a light and simplified protocol based on publish-subscribe messaging and is placed functionally over the TCP/IP protocol. It is designed to minimize the required communication bandwidth and system requirements increasing reliability and probability of successful message transmission, making it ideal for use in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication or networks where bandwidth is limited, delays are long, coverage is not reliable, and energy consumption should be as low as possible. Despite the fact that the advantage that MQTT offers its way of operating does not provide a serious level of security in how to achieve its interconnection, as it does not require protocol dependence on one intermediate third entity, the interface is dependent on each application. This paper presents an innovative real-time anomaly detection system to detect MQTT-based attacks in cyber-physical systems. This is an online-semisupervised learning neural system based on a small number of sampled patterns that identify crowd anomalies in the MQTT protocol related to specialized attacks to undermine cyber-physical systems. © 2021 Zhenyu Gao et al.},

  abstract={In the process of large-scale machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in the IoT, the Request/Response mode applied by the traditional network system can be no longer applicable due to which high network performance demand and poor expansion ability. With the characteristics of weak coupling and asynchronous communication, Publish/Subscribe mode had become an important platform in the new generation of large distributed application system. This article summarized the research status of publish/subscribe systems. According to the application scenario of data transmission of low-voltage electrical equipment, this paper discusses the realization method of data transmission system based on Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) technology. By analyzing the characteristics and simulation of MQTT protocol, it is verified that the subscription publishing model can effectively organize and publish information in the mobile computing environment and has good effectiveness. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

  abstract={With the explosive growth of massive data generated by smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices, federated learning has been envisioned as a promising technique to provide distributed machine learning services while protecting training data privacy. However, conventional federated learning protocols have shown significant drawbacks in regards of efficiency and scalability. First, since the synchronous communication model of federated learning and the computation capability of each device is different, the straggled users could severely desegregate the efficiency. Second, in synchronous communication, there is no effective client selection mechanism to make the model perform better in the early stage. Third, how to coordinate the communication of various nodes to accelerate global convergence is also one of the issues that need to be considered. To solve the above-mentioned problems, we propose a semi-asynchronous federated learning mechanism where a data expansion method is used to effectively reduce the stragglers existing in both synchronous and asynchronous communication models. Moreover, we also designed a priority function to make the accuracy increase rapidly in the early stage. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method have higher accuracy and faster convergence time compared with existing synchronization methods. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract={Many industrial IoT applications process sensor data over distributed networks to monitor devices in real-time. Since the sensor telemetries are transmitted over networks as events, imperative and event-driven programs are often used to handle IoT data. However, the inverted control flow and shared global states of these imperative programs make them difficult to interface with synchronized computation on IoT data. This problem is further complicated for high-frequency data such as electric signals, which may require dynamic adjustment to data sampling rate to operate under the constraints of network and system. In this paper, we propose a push-pull reactive programming model for IoT application to address this challenge. This model uses push-streams for asynchronous computation such as data capturing and user controls and uses pull streams for synchronized computation such as data analysis. This model is simpler than push-based models by avoiding the complexity of glitch prevention through re-sampling in pull-streams. It is also more flexible than pull-based models by allowing dynamic adjustment of the sampling rate to maintain real-time speed of the IoT computation. The push-stream has a monadic interface, which converts to a pull stream through buffering. A pull stream converts to a push-stream when driven by a clock. The dynamic switching of our streams is based on a monadic abstraction called AsyncM that uses continuation passing style and a form of cancellation token for asynchronous control. Our model is simple and can use threads or event callbacks for concurrency. © 2020 ACM.},

  abstract={At present, how to safely share data among different participants has become a huge challenge. The reliable traceability of SKA data is a powerful technical tool for controlling its security and sharing. In order to solve the problem of high management cost and low data credibility of traditional centralized big data management system, SKA data management and credible traceability model design based on Hyperledger Fabric were studied. In this paper, the overall framework and architecture of SKA data management are studied and designed, and the key technologies such as big data storage scheme, big data transmission, big data processing, blockchain metadata storage, alliance chain member allocation, traceability query, contribution mechanism and data sharing are discussed. Distributed architecture, Hyperledger Fabric alliance chain technology, database technology, Golang network programming, Rust asynchronous programming, Java Web and Vue.js are comprehensively adopted. The functions of SKA data transmission, processing, storage, traceability query and data sharing are designed. The functions of transmission, processing, storage, management, sharing and credible traceability of SKA data management system are realized, which provides a reference for the design and implementation of SKA data management system based on blockchain. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract={In this Internet of Things (IoT) era, our everyday objects have evolved into the so-called cyber-physical systems (CPS). The use and deployment of CPS has especially penetrated the industry, giving rise to the Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT (IIoT). Typically, architectures in IIoT environments are distributed and asynchronous, communication being guided by events such as the publication of (and corresponding subscription to) messages. While these architectures have some clear advantages (such as scalability and flexibility), they also raise interoperability challenges among the agents in the network. Indeed, the knowledge about the message content and its categorization (topics) gets diluted, leading to consistency problems, potential losses of information and complex processing requirements on the subscriber side to try to understand the received messages. In this paper, we present our proposal relying on AsyncAPI to automate the design and implementation of these architectures using model-based techniques for the generation of (part of) event-driven infrastructures. We have implemented our proposal as an open-source tool freely available online. © 2020 ACM.},

  abstract={With the application of the integrated modular vetronics (IMV) system in ground vehicles, the system management and software reconfiguration should be researched to improve the fault handling capability and the level of system reliability. The avionics system management standardized in the ASAAC specification is studied, and a system management and software reconfiguration scheme based on asynchronous communication is proposed for the characteristics of IMV system. In addition, the system management configurations, as well as the detail design of system management software and module management software are presented. The scheme is applied and tested in the desktop and embedded systems. The analyzed and experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the communication load in a multi-module IMV system and effectively cope with common faults of IMV system, such as abnormal exit of application software, network disconnection, module power-off, as well as redundant software running, which enables the IMV system to retain stable and self-contained under the occurrences of these faults and their combinations. © 2020, Editorial Board of Acta Armamentarii.

  abstract={In the Internet of Things (IoT), asynchronous networks with varying topology are quite common. Meanwhile, Gaussian noise and impulsive noise widely exist in asynchronous networks. Existing works on distributed estimation problems in networks primarily consider fixed topologies and Gaussian noise. Thus, these algorithms are not suitable for distributed parameter estimation in asynchronous networks. To overcome this issue, we propose a distributed diffusion kernel risk-sensitive loss (d-KRSL) algorithm, which can achieve a good performance in asynchronous networks with varying topology, and maintains the robustness to both Gaussian and impulsive noise. The mean and mean square performances of the proposed algorithm are analyzed theoretically and verified by numerical simulation results. © 2014 IEEE.},

This system is usual intricate and unbalance which affect the efficiency of power system by degrading the power quality. The most common causes by which performance of distribution system is degraded are power pilferage, unauthorized load connection, asynchronous communication and unscrupulous monitoring of system. For better quality of power system it should have the real time monitoring controlling, synchronous communication and superior cyber security and fault management.

Against the problem that the underlying multi-device data source could generate massive sensor data, this article implements the system to distribute perceptual data according to user interests on demand based on the asynchronous communication mechanism of pub/sub, and proposes a multi-level index subscription classification filtering algorithm. The algorithm mainly classifies the subscription set of the system with subscription size and the subscription frequency of attribute as tags, and completes subscription filtering according to the nature of event matching, to a certain extent reducing the number of subscriptions searched during the event-subscription matching process, accelerating the search speed of subscription. © 2020 IEEE.},

  abstract={Interface automata have been introduced as a way to advance from value and domain descriptions of type systems to temporal interface descriptions. The original introduction of interface automata used a notion of buffered communication with infinite buffer size. This communication model is suitable to abstract the behaviour of many computing aspects with asynchronous communication between components. In this paper we present Loosely Synchronous Interface Automata (LSIA) to describe interfaces of components with loosely synchronised communication. Loosely synchronised communication facilitates a blocking semantics of communication for both sender and receiver. With loosely synchronisation it is possible to describe systems where a precise order of events is necessary. For example, cyber-physical systems often include control tasks where the exact order of events is necessary for a safe operation. With LSIAs it is possible to check compatibility of interface models including safety-relevant properties like lifeness. In this paper we describe the composition of LSIAs and show examples. © 2020 IEEE},

  abstract={Recently, one of the main research topics in the context of application of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) in the Smart City and Industry 4.0 scenarios is the one related to the use of Robot Operating System (ROS)-based CPS. Specifically, one of the main interest is to allow a ROS-based smart robot communicating with other heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) applications in an intelligent environment to efficiently react to the system requirements and environment changes. However, the communication between the IoT systems will face many challenges and increase the cost and risks that lead to the requirement of a cross-platform communication for bridging the ROS-based CPS and other heterogeneous IoT applications. This paper introduces ROS Edge Node for the interoperability between Robotics domain and other IoT domains, leveraging the highly modular BRAIN-IoT federation, which allows to decentralize, compose and dynamically federate the heterogeneous IoT platforms using OSGi specification, thanks to its dynamic modularity and wide usage in IoT middlewares. Together with the flexible integration with existing IoT devices/platforms within BRAIN-IoT platform, the event-driven asynchronous communication mechanism realizes cross-platform interaction with ROS-based CPS and solves the major challenges faced. This communication mechanism allows dynamic deployment of new functionalities for enhancing/extending the behaviour of robots according to external events. In addition, some specific behaviours to new”virgin” robots, which might be needed to extend the fleet of robots or replace damaged/low batteries ones can be dynamically deployed at the setup phase. In BRAIN-IoT platform, Edge Node behaves as IoT devices/platform adaptors which integrate the existing IoT devices/platforms. The ROS Edge Node is one type of the Edge Node, which bridges the underlying ROS-based robotics systems and BRAIN-IoT execution environment, thus communicates with various IoT systems connected to the BRAIN-IoT platform. A Service Robotic use case is developed to demonstrate the proposed solution, it shows how the ROS Edge Node enables the fast adaptivity and interoperability between heterogeneous IoT domains in a federated environment.

  abstract={In recent years, Internet of Things (IoT) as an essential infrastructure for industrial development, environmental protection and human life enhancement has attracted researchers' attention. Currently, there are four hot research topics in IoT fields, including sensor design, communication scheme, secure transmission, and data mining. The LoRaWAN, an unlicensed band based long range wide area network specification, is very suitable for the activities or operations in an IoT environment due to its low power and long range communication. In the LoRaWAN, star-of-stars topology, asynchronous communication, and three communication modes are used to reduce its power consumption. In order to enhance the security of network communication, the LoRaWAN adopts the 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) and utilizes two session keys: network session key and application session key, for encrypting/decrypting data between end devices and network/application servers. However, according to the LoRaWAN Backend Interfaces 1.0 Specification announced by LoRa Alliance in 2017, the application layer communication securities between two arbitrary servers (including network servers, join server, and application servers) are out of the specification's scope. That is to say that the important data transmitted from one server to another may be attacked, falsified, or stolen easily. In this paper, a session key generation method is proposed to generate session keys with which two servers can securely communicate with each other, especially enhancing the application layer communication securities undefined in the LoRaWAN Specification. By integrating elliptic curve cryptography and AES-128, the session keys for different pairs of servers are created. The security discussion shows that the proposed method provides the features of mutual authentication, confidentiality and message integrity. Besides, it can also help to resist replay and eavesdropping attacks. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={With features such as decentralization, consistency, tamper resistance, non-repudiation, and pseudonym, blockchain technology has the potential to strengthen the Internet of Things (IoT) significantly, thus opening an intriguing research area in the integration of blockchain and IoT. However, most existing blockchain schemes were not dedicated to the IoT ecosystem and hence could not meet the specific requirements of IoT. This paper aims to fix the gap. Inspired by Chainspace, a blockchain platform which could be applicable in IoT, VChain is proposed, a novel blockchain scheme suitable for IoT which is more secure, concrete, and practical compared with Chainspace. Specifically, in VChain, a two-layer BFT-based consensus protocol with HoneyBadger BFT protocol is proposed and a collective signature scheme as building blocks. The designs above allow for supporting faulty-shards-tolerance and asynchronous network model, which could not be sustained in Chainspace, and keeping high efficiency as well. Moreover, the sharding strategy presented in VChain, different from that in RapidChain, which adopts the energy-consuming PoW mechanism for sharding, is environmentfriendly and thus makes VChain fit for IoT well. Last but not least, VChain also inherits the merits of Chainspace to separate the execution and verification of smart contracts for privacy. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract={In today's Internet of Things applications, a large number of terminal devices upload data. According to the business requirement of the server and the client, the remote server faces great challenges in data collection and data distribution. In view of the above requirements, this paper adopts Kafka middleware with fast processing speed, distributed multi-partition and high throughput to realize asynchronous communication between services, and realizes data collection and data classification through Netty framework and custom communication protocol. Implemented a high-concurrency, low-latency Message subscription system based on the Internet of Things. The experimental results show that the system meets the performance requirements of tens of thousands of data distribution. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract={Many Internet of Things and embedded projects are event driven, and therefore require asynchronous and concurrent programming. Current proposals for C++20 suggest that coroutines will have native language support. It is timely to survey the current use of coroutines in embedded systems development. This article investigates existing research which uses or describes coroutines on resource-constrained platforms. The existing research is analysed with regard to: software platform, hardware platform, and capacity; use cases and intended benefits; and the application programming interface design used for coroutines. A systematic mapping study was performed, to select studies published between 2007 and 2018 which contained original research into the application of coroutines on resource-constrained platforms. An initial set of 566 candidate papers, collated from on-line databases, were reduced to only 35 after filters were applied, revealing the following taxonomy. The C & C++ programming languages were used by 22 studies out of 35. As regards hardware, 16 studies used 8- or 16-bit processors while 13 used 32-bit processors. The four most common use cases were concurrency (17 papers), network communication (15), sensor readings (9), and data flow (7). The leading intended benefits were code style and simplicity (12 papers), scheduling (9), and efficiency (8). A wide variety of techniques have been used to implement coroutines, including native macros, additional tool chain steps, new language features, and non-portable assembly language. We conclude that there is widespread demand for coroutines on resource-constrained devices. Our findings suggest that there is significant demand for a formalised, stable, well-supported implementation of coroutines in C++, designed with consideration of the special needs of resource-constrained devices, and further that such an implementation would bring benefits specific to such devices. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

  abstract={Background: Restroom cleanliness is an important factor in hospital quality. Due to its dynamic process, it can be difficult to detect the presence of dirty restrooms that need to be cleaned. Using an Internet of Things (IoT) button can permit users to designate restrooms that need cleaning and in turn, allow prompt response from housekeeping to maintain real-time restroom cleanliness. Objective: This study aimed to describe the deployment of an IoT button–based notification system to measure hospital restroom cleanliness reporting system usage and qualitative feedback from housekeeping staff on IoT button use. Methods: We deployed IoT buttons in 16 hospital restrooms. Over an 8-month period, housekeeping staff received real-time notifications and responded to button presses for restroom cleaning. All button presses were recorded. We reported average button usage by hospital area, time of day, and day of week. We also conducted interviews with housekeeping supervisors and staff to understand their acceptance of and experience with the system. Results: Over 8 months, 1920 requests to clean restrooms in the main hospital lobby and satellite buildings were received. The hospital lobby IoT buttons received over half (N=1055, 55%) of requests for cleaning. Most requests occurred in afternoon hours from 3 PM to midnight. Requests for cleaning remained stable throughout the work week with fewer requests occurring over weekends. IoT button use was sustained throughout the study period. Interviews with housekeeping supervisors and staff demonstrated acceptance of the IoT buttons; actual use was centered around asynchronous communication between supervisors and staff in response to requests to clean restrooms. Conclusions: An IoT button system is a feasible method to generate on-demand request for restroom cleaning that is easy to deploy and that users will consistently engage with. Data from this system have the potential to enable responsive scheduling for restroom service and anticipate periods of high restroom utilization in a hospital. © Peter R Chai, Haipeng Zhang, Guruprasad D Jambaulikar, Edward W Boyer, Labina Shrestha, Loay Kitmitto, Paige G Wickner, Hojjat Salmasian, Adam B Landman.},

  abstract={Smart Home is experiencing exponential growth in research and industry. Meanwhile, a smart lock is arguably the most significant part of a smart connected home, applied widely in companies, government agencies and personal houses. Many smart locks offer a mobile app that allows user to lock and unlock doors with a simple icon tap. Nevertheless, numerous security vulnerabilities in the interaction models and practical implementations have been identified in smart locks, which may lead to burglary or personal safety issues, since the attacker could open the door lock without authorization via utilizing the vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous and consistent lock access management scheme to avoid the break-in. We also present a lightweight and efficient tree-based access control solution to such smart lock networks problems, which enables cascading deletion. The experiment results prove that our scheme provides higher security and it requires low calculation load and storage resources, ensuring it can be implemented in IoT devices. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

  abstract={The initial cloud-managed-network conceptualization of the IoT has mutated into a sparsely coupled, distributed system of interacting smart objects, or things. In this context, distributed control techniques have emerged as a tool for performing tasks locally without the support of a back-end infrastructure. Consensus algorithms are the flagship of distributed control and find application in solving problems as varied as distributed task assignment, distributed estimation, and distributed optimization. Unfortunately, typical consensus algorithms deteriorate their performance when faced with realistic communication phenomena as asynchronous communications, packet losses and channel delays. In this work, an algorithm for achieving average consensus over an IoT environment is introduced and evaluated extensively in a large-scale IoT testbed. Evaluation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves average consensus in all evaluated scenarios despite heterogeneity in the network in terms of processing and networking capabilities, packet losses and delays. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract={In this paper we introduce, Zest (REST over ZeroMQ), a middleware technology in support of an Internet of Things (IoT). Our work is influenced by the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) but emphasises systems that can support fine-grained access control to both resources and audit information, and can provide features such as asynchronous communication patterns between nodes. We achieve this by using a hybrid approach that combines a RESTful architecture with a variant of a publisher/subscriber topology that has enhanced routing support. The primary motivation for Zest is to provide inter-component communications in the Databox, but it is applicable in other contexts where tight control needs to be maintained over permitted communication patterns. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract={The exponential grow of internet of things applications leads to proposing fog computing structure that is geospatially distributed and latency sensitive. Since asynchronous dissemination of information is the main issue for typical distributed applications, publish-subscribe system is introduced as a key technology to provide asynchronous communications for distributed systems. In publish-subscribe systems, broker acts as a middleware in between subscribers and publishers and all communications are done through the brokers. However, serious security issues have been raised with such new architecture. In this paper, we propose a secure privacy-preserving mutual authentication scheme for fog-based publish-subscribe system using elliptic curve cryptography. The proposed scheme can provide mutual authentication between subscribers and brokers and between publishers and brokers. Moreover, the proposed scheme can preserve users' privacy due to the difficulty of relating the requested topic for subscription and/or publication to their anonymous identities. In addition, the proposed scheme can resist against the curiosity of users and/or brokers. The analysis of security services that are achieved by the proposed scheme is provided. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract={Multimedia content boosts the learning trends. This paper is aimed to presents an electronic learning system based on Internet of Things (IoT) for the synchronous and asynchronous communications. The infrastructure of IoT provides the adaptable, scalable and open access for the eLearning paradigm. The multimedia-based IoT-centric environment is suitable to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of learning contents. Students can take full advantage of 7As of IoT, which provides the opportunity to the students that they can access everything on the internet at any time and place. It creates a flexible eLearning paradigm for the teachers and students. The proposed eLearning modeluses sensors to detect the student location, temperature, and mobile camera to identify the student activeness in thelearning environment. Virtual campuses are controlled from a centralized location that may be called the head office. The MAQAS framework provides the solutions to the problems and analyzes the results for the efficient and connected eLearning paradigm. The MAQAS system is used to answer student’s queries, which are responded to automatically by agent-based question answering system. The results show that the students’ participation towards learning and teacher’s pedagogy are more efficient in synchronous and asynchronous modes. Performance evaluated by comparison to the existing question answering Live QA Trak, Quora Yoda QA Live and AskMSR-QA with MAQAS. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

  abstract={This article presents the Simple Packet Protocol version 2.0 (SPP 2.0). The protocol core is technology-independent and it is designed to provide communication for low data rate wired bus networks. The protocol is characterized by its low hardware requirements which allows for implementing it on embedded systems with limited hardware resources and achieving a very low price per node. An important feature of the SPP 2.0 is that its design addresses the multi-master asynchronous communication with flexible addressing model. Thanks to an effective collision avoidance and detection mechanism, the protocol is reliable under heavy network load conditions even without any additional feedback from a receiver. The presented SPP 2.0 is designed to provide wired communication for embedded systems connected with economical and maintenance-free wired network. SPP 2.0 systems can be easily integrated into larger networks, including IoT applications. The possible use cases for the protocol include: wired sensor and actuator networks, building automation systems, and modular embedded hardware platform prototyping. © 2019, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract={This paper presents an innovative mechanism for decentralized data analytics in the Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In contrast to traditional centralized (eg. Cloud) based solution, our proposed decentralized framework can avoid the problems raised in data collection such as the constraint in high latency, and the associated data breach and privacy issues. The invented mechanism enables each IoT node in the network to independently obtain the global optimal analytics with local computation and communication. The proposed framework has been tested in seismic imaging and machine learning applications. The evaluation results validate its fast convergence to the optimal model, and demonstrates that it allows (near) real-time data analytics in IoT networks under bandwidth and energy limitation, particularly in uncertain and dynamic environments. © 2019 IEEE.},

  abstract={. The multi-user detection precision and interference suppression processing efficiency of single successive interference cancellation (SIC), parallel interference cancellation (PIC) algorithm and the cascade structure interference cancellation (IC) algorithm are always affected by single-stage and multi-stage detection error diffusion. This paper focuses on the detection error diffusion of multiple access communication system with strong multiple access interference (MAI) and inter symbol interference (ISI). In this paper, a Schwarz-IC (S-IC) cascade multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm based on the monotone convergence characteristics of the Schwarz algorithm, is proposed for the multiple access mobile asynchronous communication system. The Schwarz-IC algorithm can precisely control the sub-domain boundary value of the user load power in system, efficiently track the change wireless channel, avoid the single-stage or multi-stage detection error diffusion of single interference cancellation algorithm and improve the detection convergence. Simulation results show that the Schwarz-IC algorithm is of better BER performance, detection accuracy and dynamic tracking capability. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2019.},

  abstract={Currently, mobile devices are the most popular pervasive computing devices, and they are becoming the primary way for accessing Internet. Battery is a critical resource in such personal computing gadgets, network communications being one of the primary energy consuming activities in any mobile app. Indeed, as web-based communication is the most used explicitly or implicitly by mobile devices, HTTP-based traffic is the most power demanding one. So, mobile web developers should be aware of how much energy demands the different web-based communication alternatives. The goal of this paper is to measure and compare the energy consumption of three asynchronous HTTP-based methods in mobile devices in different browsers. Our experiments focus on three HTTP-based asynchronous communication models that allow a web server to push data to a client browser through a HTTP/1.1 interaction: Polling, Long Polling, and WebSockets. The resulted measurements are then analysed to get more accurate understanding of the impact of the selected method, and the mobile browser, in the energy consumption of the asynchronous HTTP-based communication. The utility of these experiments is to show developers what are the factors and settings that mostly influence the energy consumption when different web-based asynchronous communication methods are used, helping them to choose the most beneficial solution if possible. With this information, mobile web developers should be able to reduce the power consumption of the front-end of web applications for mobile devices, just selecting and configuring the best asynchronous method or mobile browser, improving the performance of HTTP-based communication in terms of energy demand. © 2019 Inmaculada Ayala et al.},

  abstract={Distributed systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing, are becoming popular. This requires modeling that reflects the natural characteristics of such systems: the locality of independent components, the autonomy of their decisions, and asynchronous communication. Automated verification of deadlocks and distributed termination supports rapid development. Existing techniques do not reflect some features of distribution. Most formalisms are synchronous and/or use some kind of global state, both of which are unrealistic. No model supports the communication duality that allows the integration of a remote procedure call and client-server paradigm into a single, uniform model. The majority of model checkers refer to total deadlocks. Usually, they do not distinguish between communication deadlocks from resource deadlocks and deadlocks from distributed termination. Some verification mechanisms check partial deadlocks at the expense of restricting the structure of the system being verified. The paper presents an original formalism for the modeling and verification of distributed systems. The Integrated Model of Distributed Systems (IMDS) defines a distributed system as two sets: states and messages, and the relationship of the “actions” between these sets. Communication duality provides projections on servers and on traveling agents, but the uniform specification of the verified system is preserved. General temporal formulas over IMDS, independent of the structure of the verified system, allow automated verification. These formulas distinguish between deadlocks and distributed termination, and between communication deadlocks and resource deadlocks. Partial deadlocks and partial termination can be checked. The Dedan tool was developed using IMDS formalism. © 2018 by the author. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract={Energy efficiency is crucial in the design of battery-powered end devices, such as smart sensors for the Internet of Things applications. Wireless communication between these distributed smart devices consumes significant energy, and even more when data need to reach several kilometers in distance. Low-power and long-range communication technologies such as LoRaWAN are becoming popular in IoT applications. However, LoRaWAN has drawbacks in terms of (i) data latency; (ii) limited control over the end devices by the gateway; and (iii) high rate of packet collisions in a dense network. To overcome these drawbacks, we present an energy-efficient network architecture and a high-efficiency on-demand time-division multiple access (TDMA) communication protocol for IoT improving both the energy efficiency and the latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of short-range wake-up radios to achieve ultra-low power states and asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. The proposed approach still works with the standard LoRa protocol, but improves performance with an on-demand TDMA. Thanks to the proposed network and protocol, we achieve a packet delivery ratio of 100% by eliminating the possibility of packet collisions. The network also achieves a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with sensing devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 µW during periods of inactivity and can last up to three years on a 1200-mAh lithium polymer battery. © 2018 by the authors.

  abstract={We consider a communication channel where there is no common clock between the transmitter and the receiver. This is motivated by the recent interest in building system-on-chip radios for Internet of Things applications, which cannot rely on crystal oscillators for accurate timing. We identify two types of clock uncertainty in such systems: Timing jitter, which occurs at a time scale faster than the communication duration (or equivalently blocklength), and clock drift, which occurs at a slower time scale. We study the zero-error capacity under both types of timing imperfections and obtain optimal zero-error codes for some cases. Our results show that, as opposed to common practice, in the presence of clock drift, it is highly suboptimal to try to learn and track the clock frequency at the receiver; rather, one can design codes that come close to the performance of perfectly synchronous communication systems without any clock synchronization at the receiver. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract={We integrate, for the first time in the literature, the following ingredients to deal with emerging dynamic spectrum management (DSM) problem in heterogeneous wireless sensors and actuators networks (WSANs), Internet of things (IoT) and Wi-Fi: (i) named-based routing to provide provenance and location-independent access to control plane; (ii) temporary storage of control data for efficient and cohesive control dissemination, as well as asynchronous communication between software-controllers and devices; (iii) contract-based control to improve trust-ability of actions; (iv) service-defined configuration of wireless devices, approximating their configurations to real services needs. The work is implemented using NovaGenesis architecture and a proof-of-concept is evaluated in a real scenario, demonstrating our approach to automate radio frequency channel optimization in Wi-Fi and IEEE 802.15.4 networks in the 2.4 GHz bands. An integrated cognitive radio system provides the dual-mode best channel indications for novel DSM services in NovaGenesis. By reconfiguring Wi-Fi/IoT devices to best channels, the proposed solution more than doubles the network throughput, when compared to the case of mutual interference. Therefore, environments equipped with the proposal provide enhanced performance to their users. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Funding text 2: Regarding future Internet, the eXpressive Internet architecture (XIA) is a FI project funded by the USA national science foundation (NSF) [16]. Its key concepts are: (i) employs global unique identifiers for networking principals, i.e., administrative domains, hosts, services, and contents; (ii) allows services to express intent via unique IDs; (iii) flexible addressing; (iv) iterative refinement of forwarding; (v) intrinsic security. Self-certifying identifiers (XIDs) are calculated by hashing the public cryptographic keys of domains, hosts and services or the entire binary pattern of named-data. Still related to FI, recursive Internetwork architecture (RINA) is a clean slate architecture founded on the interprocess communication (IPC) abstraction [31]. RINA adopted a distributed IPC facility (DIF) to allow dynamic stack creation based on customized instances of recursive layers. In other words, DIFs have the same interface and structure, independently of their level in the protocol stack. IPCs can implement virtual network functions. RINA also has an inter-DIF directory (IDD) for name resolution (D3 and D6) and ID/Loc splitting (D7). An error and flow control protocol (EFCP) provides secure exchange of control data (D2). A common application connection establishment phase (CACEP) is employed for establishing application connections (D8), allowing applications to discover (D5) possible peer names. To the best of our knowledge, neither XIA, nor RINA have been applied for cognitive radio and DSM yet.

  abstract={Processing data at different rates is generally a hard problem in reactive programming. Buffering problems, lags, and concurrency issues often occur. Many of these problems are clock errors, where data at different rates is combined incorrectly. Techniques to avoid clock errors, such as type-level clocks and deterministic scheduling, exist in the field of synchronous programming, but are not implemented in general-purpose languages like Haskell. Rhine is a clock-safe library for synchronous and asynchronous Functional Reactive Programming (FRP). It separates the aspects of clocking, scheduling and resampling from each other, and ensures clock-safety at the type level. Concurrent communication is encapsulated safely. Diverse reactive subsystems can be combined in a coherent, declarative data-flow framework, while correct interoperability of data at different rates is guaranteed by type-level clocks. This provides a general-purpose framework that simplifies multi-rate FRP systems and can be used for game development, media applications, GUIs and embedded systems, through a flexible API with many reusable components. © 2018 ACM.},

  abstract={Due to the complex application scenarios, the publish-subscribe (PS) system suffers from masses of security attacks. In order to protect the system security and users privacy, an access control scheme based on full homomorphic encryption (FHE) for PS system, named access control scheme based on full homomorphic encryption (ACHO), has been proposed in this article. ACHO can guarantee the features of decoupling users' interactions and asynchronous communications for PS system. Meanwhile, ACHO can protect the confidentiality of system data and support the system scalability. Specifically, 1) ACHO utilizes the FHE to encrypt the data published in the PS system, 2) it embeds the access control structure and the access attributes to achieve the aim of access control. Security analysis shows that the ACHO can guarantee the correctness and security in theory. Moreover, the experimental results show that ACHO can efficiently achieve the trade-off between the system cost and the security demand. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.

  abstract={While smart contracts are praised widely, it should be noted that they have their disadvantages: lack of control over data protection and executive correctness or consistency. Aiming at this problem, we propose SMPC-based smart contract platform with three-layer structure: contract, computing, and group communication layer. In contract layer, we put forward SMPC-based smart contract framework, which gives the implementation process, language structure and grammar specification of smart contracts. In computing layer, fair SMPC algorithms based on general linear secret sharing scheme are designed to implement verifiable collaboration computing with input privacy and computation correctness. In group communication layer, the non-blocking broadcast is developed from non-blocking message passing interface (MPI)in order to ensure secure group communication in asynchronous networks with node and link failures. Finally, the results of simulation experiments with private currency transfers indicate that our platform is efficient and secure enough for common smart contracts. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract={Virtualization technology, which has achieved great success in server and desktop environments in the last few years, is currently extending itself towards a new territory: embedded system. OKL4 from Open Kernel Labs is a leading virtualization software for embedded systems. Its microkernel approach can improve plain virtualization technologies, but it also brings incomplete IPC (Inter-Process Communication) issues. This paper proposes a novel asynchronous communication mechanism that can generate multiple event channels and efficiently manage concurrent communication requests between virtual machines. This mechanism optimizes the original IPC mechanism, and this paper also proposes a shared-memorybased bulk data transmission mechanism. The final experiments prove its feasibility and demonstrate the specific effect. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract={Multimedia content boosts the learning trends. This Multimedia and Agents based Question Answering System (MAQAS) is based on Internet of Things in eLearning paradigm. It is aimed to give help especially to the students in finding the more relevant and accurate answers to their questions. This system is for both synchronous and asynchronous communications. The multimedia-based IoT-centric environment is suitable to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of learning contents. This creates a flexible eLearning paradigm for the teachers and students. The proposed eLearning model uses sensors to detect the student location, temperature, and mobile camera to identify the student's presence at a suitable place, inappropriate atmosphere and his activeness in a learning environment, respectively. Three agents are playing vital roles in making the smart decision about student-teacher interactions. Experimentation is performed and the initial results are drawn. Accuracy value of MAQAS is compared with the well-known existing QA systems; LIVE QA TRACK, QUORA, YODA QA LIVE, AND ASKMSR-QA concerning three types of WH Questions. The overall performance of the proposed systems is proved to be better compared to other competing systems. It was also concluded that eLearning with multimedia settles the goodness of an IoT-based solution. It also enhances the QA to Multimedia and Agent-based Question Answering System. © 2018 ACM.},

  abstract={In this paper, we explore the idea that 5G will permit the use of multiple waveforms, with each service employing a waveform that is best suited for it. We look at a 5G machine-type communication (MTC) scenario consisting of clustered user equipment employing device-to-device (D2D) communication, such as a smart factory with intercommunicating machinery. The overhead associated with synchronizing a large number of machine-type D2D user equipment (DUE) comes at a cost that may render synchronous communication infeasible or undesirable. Based on this motivation, we consider multiple possible combinations of prominent 5G waveform candidates for cellular users and DUEs, examining the asynchronous performance of all waveforms under consideration and using the performance of synchronous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as a baseline for comparison. Specifically, we focus on the coexistence of waveforms in which the ordinary cellular users employ OFDM for synchronous communication, as in LTE, and the machine-type DUEs, operating asynchronously, employ a different waveform. When DUEs employ filter bank multicarrier with offset-QAM, the average achieved rate is marginally greater than the synchronous OFDM baseline case, and approximately 43% greater than the asynchronous OFDM case. This result is encouraging, as the benefits of asynchronous D2D communication could be enjoyed in MTC scenarios without suffering any performance reduction compared to the synchronous OFDM scenario. We then investigate how the relative performance of different waveform choices depends on the scenario by varying key parameters. Notably, for asynchronous communication, increasing the transmit power of DUEs results in diminishing benefits unless the DUEs employ a waveform that mitigates interdevice leakage interference. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract={Currently, mobile devices are the most popular pervasive computing device, and they are becoming the primer way forWeb access. Energy is a critical resource in such pervasive computing devices, being network communication one of the primary energy consuming operations in mobile apps. Indeed, web-based communication is the most used, but also energy demanding. So, mobile web developers should be aware of how much energy consumes the different web-based communication alternatives. The goal of this paper is to measure and compare the energy consumption of three asynchronous Web-based methods in mobile devices. Our experiments consider three different Web applications models that allow a web server to push data to a browser: Polling, Long Polling and WebSockets. The obtained results are analyzed to get more accurate understanding of the impact in energy consumption of a mobile browser for each of these three methods. The utility of these experiments is to show developers what are the factors that influence the energy consumption when different web-based asynchronous communication is used. With this information mobile web developers could reduce the power consumption of web applications on mobile devices, by selecting the most appropriate method for asynchronous server communication. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract={Embedded virtualization systems become increasingly important in the light of mobile computing era. Current OKL4 technology has overcome some limitations of plain virtualization by introducing microkernel approach but also imposes several concerns including incomplete IPC (Inter-Process Communication). With this in mind, in this paper a novel asynchronous communication mechanism to optimize original OKL4 IPC mechanism is proposed. The mechanism is able to effectively deal with concurrent communication requests between any virtual machines (VMs) by generating multiple event channels and providing a complete management mechanism. Further, a shared-memory-based bulk data transfer mechanism based on asynchronous communication mechanism is proposed to enrich OKL4 primitive data exchange approaches. In the end, the promising experiment results prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the mechanisms. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract={Wireless sensor and actuator networks play a central role in the Internet of Things, and a lot of effort is devoted to enable energy efficient and low latency communications. In the recent years, low power communications has evolved towards multi-kilometer ranges and low bit-rate approaches such as LoRa™. However, the medium access layer protocols rely on the well-known duty-cycling schemes, which require a trade-off between power consumption and latency for message transfer from the gateway to the nodes. Domains such as industrial applications in which sensors and actuators are part of the control loop require predictable latency, as well as low power consumption. Emerging ultra-low-power wake-up receivers enable pure-asynchronous communications, allowing both low latency and low power consumption, but at the cost of a lower sensitivity and lower range than traditional wireless receivers and LoRa™. In this work, we propose an energy efficient architecture that combines long-range communication with ultra low-power short-range wake-up receivers to achieve both energy efficient and low latency communication in heterogeneous long-short range networks. A hardware architecture as well as a protocol is proposed to exploit the benefits of these two communication schemes. Experimental measurements and analytical comparisons show that the proposed approach remove the need for a trade-off between power consumption and latency. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The communication between agents is realized via some communication functionals that alter the rates of discrete transitions of stochastic agents. The control is then realized using the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation associated to the macroscopic behavior of the multi-agent system. The coordination is achieved when the multi-agent system lies in the steady-state regime associated to the invariant measures that characterize the limiting behaviors. © 2018},

  abstract={This paper investigates rewriting logic as a suitable means to model the semantics of distributed and concurrent systems implemented using Monitoring Oriented Programming (MOP) frameworks. MOP tools close the gap between specification and implementation, allowing several formal specifications and concrete implementations to be combined into a single executing system. To address real-time monitoring of modern distributed applications, we recently proposed REAL-T, a reactive event-based distributed programming language with explicit support for distributions and time manipulation. REAL-T allows programmers to instrument distributed applications to monitor and enforce specific behavior. It also supports requirements of modern reactive applications (responsiveness, resiliency, elasticity and asynchronous communication). The REAL-T programming model is very flexible, making the semantic specifications very challenging. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.},

  abstract={We apply the Infinite-State Model Checking to formally specify and validate protocol skeletons for distributed systems with asynchronous communication and synchronous access to local data structures. More precisely, we validate the Redis Pub/Sub key-value Server. Redis is based on a publish-subscribe architecture used in Cloud Storage and Internet of Things ecosystems. For the considered protocol, we present a formal specification that combines ideas coming from round-based and shared-memory specification languages. The resulting model is validated via the SMT-based Infinite-state Model Checker Cubicle. In this setting we use unbounded arrays to model (1) arbitrary collections of publishers and subscribers, (2) unbounded shared memory used as a communication media between processes. Our model is validated using the symbolic backward reachability algorithm implemented in the tool. The peculiarity of the algorithm is that, upon termination, the resulting correctness proof is guaranteed to hold for every number of process instances. © Copyright 2018 for the individual papers by the papers' authors.},

  abstract={In recent years, we are witnessing a growing interest in large-scale situated systems, such as those falling under the umbrella of pervasive computing, Cyber-Physical Systems, and the Internet of Things. The actor model is a natural choice for designing and implementing such systems, thanks to the ability of actors to address distribution, autonomy of control, and asynchronous communication: namely, it is convenient to view the pervasive cyberspace as an environment densely inhabited by mobile situated actors. But how can an actor-centric development approach be fruitfully used to engineer a complex coordination strategy, where a myriad of devices/actors performs adaptive distributed sensing/processing/acting? Aggregate computing has been proposed as an emerging paradigm that faces this general problem by adopting a global, system-level stance, allowing to specify and functionally compose collective behaviours by operating on diffused data structures, known as “computational fields”. In this paper, we develop on the idea of integrating the actor model and aggregate computing, presenting a software framework where declarative global-level system specifications are automatically turned into an underlying system of Scala/Akka actors carrying complex coordination tasks involving large sets of devices spread over the pervasive computing system. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract={The energy efficient Data Timed Sending (DTS) protocol enables information transfer from sensor nodes to sink host by choosing the appropriate transmission time of a short packet without data payload. Wake-up Radio (WuR) devices allow asynchronous communication of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) putting the sensor nodes’ main radio modules in continuous sleep state thus increasing energy efficiency. A common characteristic for the DTS protocol and WuR is that they are designed for applications where sensors take sparse measurements, typically one measurement every few minutes. This paper investigates the combination of the DTS protocol with WuR into a single integrated solution. The analytical analysis shows that the DTS protocol significantly reduces the energy consumption when coupled with WuR making this solution suitable for applications with battery powered WSN (e.g. body area WSN). © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2018.},

  abstract={JavaScript code running in the Node.js runtime is a major platform for developers building cloud, mobile, or IoT applications. A fundamental concept in Node.js programming is the use of asynchronous callbacks and event loops to provide highly responsive applications. While conceptually simple, this programming model contains numerous subtleties and behaviors that are defined implicitly by the current Node.js implementation. This paper presents the first comprehensive formalization of the Node.js asynchronous execution model and defines a high-level notion of async-contexts to formalize fundamental relationships between asynchronous executions in an application. These formalizations provide a foundation for the construction of static or dynamic program analysis tools, support the exploration of alternative Node.js event loop implementations, and provide a high-level conceptual framework for reasoning about relationships between the execution of asynchronous callbacks in a Node.js application. © 2017 Owner/Author.},

  abstract={Clustered manycore architectures itted with a Network-on-Chip (NoC) and scratchpad memories enable highly energy-eicient and time-predictable implementations. However, porting applications to such processors represents a programming challenge. Inspired by supercomputer one-sided communication libraries and by OpenCL async_work_group_copy primitives, we propose a simple programming layer for communication and synchronization on clustered manycore architectures. We discuss the design and implementation of this layer on the 2nd-generation Kalray MPPA processor, where it is available from both OpenCL and POSIX C/C++ multithreaded programming models. Our measurements show that it allows to reach up to 94% of the theoretical hardware throughput with a best-case latency round-trip of 2.2 s when operating at 500 MHz. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

  abstract={In wireless environments, transmission and reception costs dominate system power consumption, motivating research effort on new technologies capable of reducing the footprint of the radio, paving the way for the Internet of Things. The most important challenge is to reduce power consumption when receivers are idle, the so called idle-listening cost. One approach proposes switching off the main receiver, then introduces new wake-up circuitry capable of detecting an incoming transmission, optionally discriminating the packet destination using addressing, then switching on the main radio only when required. This wake-up receiver technology represents the ultimate frontier in low power radio communication. In this paper, we present a comprehensive literature review of the research progress in wake-up radio (WuR) hardware and relevant networking software. First, we present an overview of the WuR system architecture, including challenges to hardware design and a comparison of solutions presented throughout the last decade. Next, we present various medium access control and routing protocols as well as diverse ways to exploit WuRs, both as an extension of pre-existing systems and as a new concept to manage low-power networking. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={Internet of Things is capturing attention of consumer and enterprise electronics market with rapid implementations in home automation, smart cities, etc. Several power efficient, low cost sensors have been made available to developers to build these applications. A common theme here is the mode of communication where the computationally intensive work is being done at server side and the sensor-actuator work in done at client side. This requires networking infrastructure to be robust which is not the case across the world. To reduce the risk of failure, we propose an offline online strategy for IoT applications where MQTT protocol is used for asynchronous communication. We implement a portable e-voting system on Intel Galileo to demonstrate the feasibility of such an extension without compromising on functionality. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract={In the 5G era, it is expected that various services will be provided on network slices, which are virtualized network resources. Unlike the uniform service level provided in the current Internet, a network slice has to support multiple service levels for various types of services such as IP telephony, Internet-access and IoT/M2M. Because their requirements are quite different. IP telephony and Internet-access services require high reliability due to their essential role in communication. However, some IoT/M2M services do not necessarily require high reliability since they can tolerate temporary disconnection of networks due to their asynchronous communications. Instead of reliability, they require low-cost connectivity. Therefore, future networks have to support multi-level reliability required by services on a single physical network. In this paper, we propose a multi-level reliability architecture in optical cross-connect based metro networks to satisfy broad service requirements. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a plug-and-play on-chip asynchronous communication network aimed at the dynamic reconfiguration of a low-power adaptive circuit such as an internet of things (IoT) system. By using a separate communication network, we can address both digital and analog blocks at a lower configuration cost, increasing the overall system power efficiency. As reconfiguration only occurs according to specific events and has to be automatically in stand-by most of the time, our design is fully asynchronous using handshake protocols. The paper presents the circuit’s architecture, performance results, and an example of the reconfiguration of frequency locked loops (FLL) to validate our work. We obtain an overall energy per bit of 0.07 pJ/bit for one stage, in a 28 nm Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator (FDSOI) technology at 0.6 V and a 1.1 ns/bit latency per stage. © 2017 by the authors.

  abstract={Many scenarios require confidential communication and protection against active attackers. The way to establish trust between devices and authenticate these networks depends completely on the scenario. In Body Area Networks human biometrics can serve as a shared secret among devices. In real-time voice communication, the ZRTP protocol allows for interactive trust establishment by recognizing the peer's voice. In asynchronous networks, such as email, other interactive mechanisms have been deployed, such as key fingerprint verification. In our research, we are analyzing the security and usability of existing trust mechanisms for heterogeneous networks. Furthermore, we are proposing protocol changes and new mechanisms to establish trust between devices. In this paper an overview is given over existing and upcoming research in this area. For synchronous networks, human biometrics, such as human gait or a peer's voice, are used as trust anchors. For asynchronous networks, the usability of interactive public-key verification mechanism are analyzed as trust anchors. © 2017 IEEE.},

  abstract={The integration of robots with the Internet is nowadays an emerging trend, as new form of the Internet-of-Things (IoT). This integration is crucially important to promote new types of cloud robotics applications where robots are virtualized, controlled and monitored through the Internet. This paper proposes ROSLink, a new protocol to integrate Robot Operating System (ROS) enabled-robots with the IoT. The motivation behind ROSLink is the lack of ROS functionality in monitoring and controlling robots through the Internet. Although, ROS allows control of a robot from a workstation using the same ROS master, however this solution is not scalable and rather limited to a local area network. Solutions proposed in recent works rely on centralized ROS Master or robot-side Web servers sharing similar limitations. Inspired from the MAVLink protocol, the proposed ROSLink protocol defines a lightweight asynchronous communication protocol between the robots and the end-users through the cloud. ROSLink leverages the use of a proxy cloud server that links ROS-enabled robots with users and allows the interconnection between them. ROSLink performance was tested on the cloud and was shown to be efficient and reliable. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

  abstract={Model-driven development (MDD) deals with complexities of modern software development by using models. Their verification is one of the opportunities of MDD, since it can be performed in the early stages of the development. The prevailing trend in verification of MDD models has been to translate them to an input language of one of the existing tools, most notably model checkers. Such an approach has advantages; for instance, we can use tools that achieved a higher level of maturity, including SPIN, NuSMV and Java PathFinder. However, the input languages of model checkers are typically not compatible with MDD models, which can make the translations very complex and difficult to maintain. Moreover, it is more difficult to take advantage of specific features of the structure and semantics of models to, e.g., speed up analysis. In this paper, we depart from the translational trend and present more direct and dedicated approach. We use an MDD language, namely UML-RT (used in IBM Rational Software Architect RealTime Edition), and we introduce a verification method built around its main features such as hierarchical structures, action code and asynchronous communication. In our method we use a formalization tailored to UML-RT models. This enables very easy transformation of models, but also reduces the necessary translations of verification results and directly supports the most important features of UML-RT. The proposed method includes an on-the-fly model checking algorithm based on the original CTL labeling. This algorithm is further optimized to include lazy composition. In the paper, we present all necessary components of the checking algorithms. Additionally, we also show the results of experiments with our implementation using several UML-RT models and CTL formulas. The experiments provide some evidence of the viability of a language-specific analysis of MDD models and of the effectiveness of our optimizations in certain cases. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Recently, the Secure Average Time Synchronization (SATS) protocol has been proposed and analyzed; this distributed clock synchronization protocol is capable of successfully tackling several attacks such as denial-of-service (DoS), message-delay, message duplication/repetition, and even a generic message manipulation. However, the collusion attack, in which neighboring malicious nodes may cooperate so as to strike stealthier attacks that are more difficult to handle, remains by and large an open problem. In the setup of SATS, we derive the fundamental asymptotic bounds in the number of malicious agents-as function of the benign ones-that can be efficiently handled without tampering accurate network-wide synchronization. Going a step further, we develop a risk model for collusions and use it to obtain even tighter bounds. In specific, we establish that SATS can handle 'many' malicious nodes with high probability: an order of almost square-root of the benign ones for the case of no risk, and almost linear when the risk of collusion is accounted. Last but not least, we analyze and experimentally assess an interesting phenomenon: the presence of attackers may lead to a convergence speedup of SATS, since malicious nodes can be effectively constrained from the network, thus affecting the algebraic connectivity of the graph corresponding to the network topology. Numerical simulations verify the theoretical results, i.e., collusions are avoided when the number of malicious nodes is bounded by the asymptotic bounds and the algebraic connectivity increases due to incorporating 'well behaved' malicious nodes. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract={In this paper, a novel software design architecture namely MATCOM (Multiple Active Threads with Cooperative Multitasking) for an embedded application with time critical access/control and peripheral data communication processes, is presented. The timing analysis of various functional processes in the software application is performed and the suggested method uses multithreading (Multiple active threads) and timer (Cooperative multitasking) in parallel. The method is also validated through the quantization of data transceiver's packet loss for communication with the other subsystems. The MATCOM architecture has helped us in building an efficient, accurate and modular application which has been validated through timing analysis and the data transceiver packet loss measurements. In addition to quantizing the performance improvement through packet loss measurements, the implementation also sorted out some synchronization issues and a few unparallel conditions. The timing estimates are guaranteed by the proposed method meeting the timing constraints and validated through measurements. The implementation of the related application in an embedded controller environment is reported herewith and the practical performance improvement is shown through experimental results. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract={The paper describes a new asynchronous communication network for reconfiguration of adaptive Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) nodes. The use of adaptive blocks is motivated by the need to increase the performance of the node while being energy efficient. They are able to adapt their performance to the environment, the energy budget and the task. The purpose of the proposed communication network is to handle control signals, both in sleep and working mode of the node at a low energy cost. We show that we can achieve a 0.07pJ/bit in energy per bit and 1.1ns/bit in latency in a 28nm FDSOI technology at 0.6V in asynchronous QDI logic. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract={Distributed algorithms have many mission-critical applications ranging from embedded systems and replicated databases to cloud computing. Due to asynchronous communication, process faults, or network failures, these algorithms are difficult to design and verify. Many algorithms achieve fault tolerance by using threshold guards that, for instance, ensure that a process waits until it has received an acknowledgment from a majority of its peers. Consequently, domain-specific languages for fault-tolerant distributed systems offer language support for threshold guards. We introduce an automated method for model checking of safety and liveness of threshold-guarded distributed algorithms in systems where the number of processes and the fraction of faulty processes are parameters. Our method is based on a short counterexample property: if a distributed algorithm violates a temporal specification (in a fragment of LTL), then there is a counterexample whose length is bounded and independent of the parameters. We prove this property by (i) characterizing executions depending on the structure of the temporal formula, and (ii) using commutativity of transitions to accelerate and shorten executions. We extended the ByMC toolset (Byzantine Model Checker) with our technique, and verified liveness and safety of 10 prominent fault-tolerant distributed algorithms, most of which were out of reach for existing techniques. © 2017 Owner/Author.},

  abstract={Environment and agriculture related applications have been gaining ground for the past several years and have been the context for researches in ubiquitous and pervasive computing. This study is a part of a bigger study that uses artificial intelligence in developing models to detect, monitor, and forecast the spread of Fusarium oxysporum cubense TR4 (FOC TR4) on Cavendish bananas cultivated in the Philippines. To implement an Intelligent Farming system, 1) wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) are deployed in Philippine banana plantations to collect soil parameter data that is considered to affect the health of Cavendish bananas, 2) a custom built smartphone application is used for collecting, storing, and transmitting soil data, plant images and plant status data to a cloud storage, and 3) a custom built web application is used to load and display results of physico-chemical analysis of soil, analysis of data models, and geographic locations of plants being monitored. This study discusses the issues, considerations, and solutions implemented in the development of an asynchronous communication channel to ensure that all data collected by WSNs and smartphone applications are transmitted with a high degree of accuracy and reliability. From a design standpoint: standard API documentation on usage of data type is required to avoid inconsistencies in parameter passing. From a technical standpoint, there is a need to include error-handling mechanisms especially for delays in transmission of data as well as generalize method of parsing thru multidimensional array of data. Strategies are presented in the paper. © 2017 SPIE.},

  abstract={Mobile cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are very hard to verify, because of asynchronous communication and the arbitrary number of components. Verification via model checking typically becomes impracticable due to the state space explosion caused by the system parameters and concurrency. In this paper, we propose a formal approach to verify the safety properties of parameterized protocols in mobile CPS. By using counter abstraction, the protocol is modeled as a Petri net. Then, a novel algorithm, which uses IC3 (the state-of-the-art model checking algorithm) as the back-end engine, is presented to verify the Petri net model. The experimental results show that our new approach can greatly scale the verification capabilities compared favorably against several recently published approaches. In addition to solving the instances fast, our method is significant for its lower memory consumption. © 2017 Long Zhang et al.},

  abstract={The programmable material is one of the most challenging problems in micro-robot networking. In addition to the problems that arise by the miniaturization of millimeter-scale mobile devices, the conception of the distributed asynchronous algorithms allowing the coordination of large number of robots remains a very complex task. Micro-robot network represents one of the implementations of the Internet of things, where a set of micro-robots react to an order submitted on a wireless downlink channel specifying a global goal. This goal corresponds to a target shape in the case of shape-shifting problem. Programmable materials have many applications in the field of paintable displays, prototyping, locomotion, etc. We propose in this paper an original flexible distributed algorithm allowing to reorganize a modular micro-robot network into a desired target shape (physical topology). The efficiency of such an algorithm is assessed on the basis of the memory requirements, the communication load, and the number of performed movements to reach the final shape. The proposed algorithm shows a great flexibility concerning the range of target shapes that can be achieved, in part because there is no need for an explicit description of the final shape. To assess the computational performances of the presented algorithm, we proposed a linear programming model of the shape-shifting problem that provides a lower bound of optimized criteria. The comparison of our results with those given by the relaxed linear programming proves the efficiency of our approach. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract={The body temperature is one of the important parameters for cow health status and also is one of great significance reference for disease diagnosis and treatment. The data collection of cow body temperature by manual can't be real-timing and sometimes has errors so that brings a lot of difficulties to management. In view of development of computer technology and applications in the agriculture, based on the current mainstream of WiFi, a real-time monitoring system was applied to inspect the variation of cow body temperature. The digital temperature sensor DS18B20 was used to collect cow's aural temperature, communicated with ESP-WROOM module that was integrated Tensilica L106, 32-bit microcontroller (MCU), a 16-bit RSIC with the complete system and self-contained WiFi networking capabilities through one-wire connector. At the first time ESP-WROOM module must be configured by SmartConfig protocol with AP's (Access point) parameters which aiming to be slinked with AP. Once the connection was successfully established, the temperature data will be sent to MCU. After received, MCU packs data and parameters send to server through TCP protocol. And the data collected were stored in MySQL database respectively in different cows. The soft system programmed with Java language can achieve real-time acquisition, storage, display and inquiry of cow's temperature data. The asynchronous communication models in view of Java NIO class were used to solve the masses of service requests delivered and the request congestion excluded. The results of experiment showed that errors of the proposed device were ±0.2℃ with the range of 30~50℃, the proper transfer distance of sensor node was 80 m, and the loss rate of network passage was 4.42%. The power consumption was decreased with collecting time and sleep mode. It is proved that the characteristic of low-power, small bulk, high precision of sample can be provided and applied practically. © 2016, Chinese Society of Agricultural Machinery.

  abstract={In this paper, we consider a network of agents monitoring a spatially distributed arrival process. Each node measures the number of arrivals seen at its monitoring point in a given time interval with the objective of estimating the unknown local arrival rate. We propose an asynchronous distributed approach based on a Bayesian model with unknown hyperparameter, where each node computes the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator of its local arrival rate in a distributed way. As a result, the estimation at each node 'optimally' fuses the information from the whole network through a distributed optimization algorithm. Moreover, we propose an ad-hoc distributed estimator, based on a consensus algorithm for time-varying and directed graphs, which exhibits reduced complexity and exponential convergence. We analyze the performance of the proposed distributed estimators, showing that they i) are reliable even in presence of limited local data and ii) improve the estimation accuracy compared to the purely decentralized setup. Finally, we provide a statistical characterization of the proposed estimators. In particular, for the ad-hoc estimator, we show that as the number of nodes goes to infinity its mean square error converges to the optimal one. Numerical Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical characterization and highlight the appealing performances of the estimators. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a suite of asynchronous distributed optimization algorithms for wide-area oscillation estimation in power systems using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs). We first pose the estimation problem as a real-time, iterative, and distributed consensus problem. Thereafter, we consider a probabilistic traffic model for modeling delays in any typical wide-area communication network, and study how the delays enter the process of information exchange between distributed phasor data concentrators that are employed to execute this consensus algorithm in a coordinated fashion. Finally, we propose four different strategies by which the convergence rate and accuracy of this consensus algorithm can be made immune to the asynchrony resulting from the network traffic. We carry out extensive simulations to show possible numerical instabilities and sensitivities of the ADMM convergence on our proposed strategies. Our results exhibit a broad view of how the convergence of any distributed estimation algorithm in a generic cyber-physical system depends strongly on the uncertainties of the underlying communication models. © 2016 IEEE.},

  abstract={Consistency is hard and coordination is expensive. As we move into the world of connected 'Internet of Things' style applications, or large-scale mobile applications, devices have less power, periods of limited connectivity, and operate over unreliable asynchronous networks. This poses a problem with shared state: how do we handle concurrent operations over shared state, while clients are offline,and ensure that values converge to a desirable result without making the system unavailable? We look at a new programming model, called Lasp. This programming model combines distributed convergent data structures with a dataflow execution model designed for distribution over large-scale applications. © 2016 ACM.},

  abstract={This paper presents general techniques for verifying virtually synchronous distributed control systems with interconnected physical environments. Such cyber-physical systems (CPSs) are notoriously hard to verify, due to their combination of nontrivial continuous dynamics, network delays, imprecise local clocks, asynchronous communication, etc. To simplify their analysis, we first extend the PALS methodology|that allows to abstract from the timing of events, asynchronous communication, network delays, and imprecise clocks, as long as the infrastructure guarantees bounds on the network delays and clock skews|from real-Time to hybrid systems. We prove a bisimulation equivalence between Hybrid PALS synchronous and asynchronous models. We then show how various verification problems for synchronous Hybrid PALS models can be reduced to SMT solving over nonlinear theories of the real numbers. We illustrate the Hybrid PALS modeling and verification methodology on a number of CPSs, including a control system for turning an airplane. © 2016 ACM.},

  abstract={The recent advent of ambient intelligence is enabled by parallel technological advancements in sensing, context recognition, embedded systems and communications. This paper focuses on the communication issues of embedded systems, particularly the latency Quality of Service (QoS) metric and the multi-hop communications with Bluetooth standard, to examine the viability of communications of embedded systems in AmI environments and applications. Bluetooth is a worldwide radio license-free technology that enables the creation of low-power multi-hop networks interconnecting multiple devices. Bluetooth sets the procedure to establish piconets (point-to-point and point-to-multipoint links) and scatternets (multi-hop communications), and hence, Bluetooth nodes can be interconnected to form wireless networks. This paper presents research on multi-hop latency that was conducted using a custom-built test platform. Moreover, an empirical model is derived to calculate the latency over asynchronous links when links in scatternets are always active or in sniff mode. The designers of ambient intelligent devices and networks can take advantage of the model and the estimation of the delay in Bluetooth multi-hop networks presented in this paper. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

  abstract={A global phenomenon of population ageing and an increasing number of patients with chronic diseases place substantial additional pressure on healthcare systems. A possible solution for this problem is a new emerging sort of pervasive personal healthcare service that is focused on the patient and allows the patient to be actively involved in his or her own health care. In this paper, we propose the architecture of the pervasive personal healthcare service which is based on the existing technologies available to almost everyone. Along with the conventional request-response synchronous communication, the proposed system features asynchronous communication based on the publish-subscribenotify model. In order to perform asynchronous communication, a web application server is integrated with the Google Cloud Messaging service. The communication between mobile device and servers is carried out through the available Wi-Fi or mobile networks, whereas Bluetooth protocol is a conventional for Body Sensor Networks consisting of wearable sensor devices. We also present a mobile application which has been developed with the use-case driven approach for both patients and medical personnel. The introduced application has a form of a nonintrusive customized mobile social network. We explain usage scenarios that clarify the required functions and present conclusions based on the system test.},

  abstract={The models@run.time paradigm promotes the use of models during the execution of cyber-physical systems to represent their context and to reason about their runtime behaviour. However, current modeling techniques do not allow to cope at the same time with the large-scale, distributed, and constantly changing nature of these systems. In this paper, we introduce a distributed models@run.time approach, combining ideas from reactive programming, peer-to-peer distribution, and large-scale models@run.time. We define distributed models as observable streams of chunks that are exchanged between nodes in a peer-to-peer manner. A lazy loading strategy allows to transparently access the complete virtual model from every node, although chunks are actually distributed across nodes. Observers and automatic reloading of chunks enable a reactive programming style. We integrated our approach into the Kevoree Modeling Framework and demonstrate that it enables frequently changing, reactive distributed models that can scale to millions of elements and several thousand nodes. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract={In this paper, we design and implement an asynchronous multi-device acoustic localization system. Although the relative position and distance can be useful to many applications such as drone swarming, not much research has been conducted on the field. As synchronizing multiple devices can be difficult or even impossible with certain hardware, we devised an asynchronous algorithm that provides a high accuracy ranging and localization. A high performance ranging and localization technique that uses a relatively minor source, sound, can provide a new set of characteristics. Our proposed algorithm can work on most commercial devices that have acoustic capabilities.},

  abstract={In this paper, we tackle the challenge of rapidly disseminating rare events through a multi-hop network, while achieving unprecedented energy-efficiency. Contrary to state-of-theart approaches, we circumvent the undesirable trade-offs associated with low-power duty-cycled protocols and backscatter technologies, and demonstrate a paradigm shift in lowpower protocol design. We present Zippy, an on-demand flooding technique that provides robust asynchronous network wake-up, fine-grained per-hop synchronization and efficient data dissemination by leveraging low-complexity transmitter and receiver hardware. We are the first to demonstrate the on-demand flooding of rare events through a multihop network with end-to-end latencies of tens of milliseconds, while dissipating less than 10 microwatts during periods of inactivity. We present a prototype implementation of our proposed approach using a wireless sensor platform constructed from commercially available components. We extensively evaluate Zippy's performance in a laboratory setting and in an indoor testbed. © 2015 ACM.},

  abstract={Distributed IMA, as described in RTCA DO-297, has been used in different forms since 1980s in avionics and modular aircraft control architectures which deploy synchronous or time-division multiplexing for deterministic communication. Such a time-driven communication enables specific capabilities in architecture and embedded platform design, which cannot be realized by asynchronous communication. In complex integrated systems, Distributed IMA enables full virtualization of embedded resources to host distributed hard RT functions. Distributed IMA supports full separation of controlled objects (actuators), input/output devices and sensors from the computing modules in aerospace and other cross-industry applications. This simplifies reconfiguration, and design of generic open architectures. With synchronous and time-division multiplexing in Ethernet networks, critical functions can also be hosted in open systems or in systems where the behavior of non-critical functions cannot be fully assessed. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract={The current version of the Safety Critical Java (SCJ) specification defines three compliance levels. Level 0 targets single processor programs while Level 1 and 2 can support multiprocessor platforms. Level 1 programs must be fully partitioned but Level 2 programs can also be more globally scheduled. As of yet, there is no official Reference Implementation for SCJ. However, the icecap project has produced a Safety-Critical Java Run-time Environment based on the Hardware-near Virtual Machine (HVM). This supports SCJ at all compliance levels and provides an implementation of the safety-critical Java (Javax.safetycritical) package. This is still work-in-progress and lacks certain key features. Among these is the ability to support multiprocessor platforms. In this paper, we explore two possible options to adding multiprocessor support to this environment: the "green thread" and the "native thread" approaches. The "native thread" approach is adopted and the design and implementation of a revised icecap SCJ run-time environment is discussed. © 2015 ACM.},

  abstract={In our recent paper [1], we proposed a distributed PMU-PDC architecture for estimating power system oscillation modes by integrating a Prony-based algorithm with Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). A critical assumption behind the proposed method was that the communication between local PDCs and the central averager is completely synchronized. In realistic wide-area networks, however, such synchronous communication may not always be possible. In this paper we address this issue of asynchronous communication, and its impact on the convergence of the distributed estimation. We first impose a probability model for the communication delays between the central PDC and the local PDCs, and then implement two strategies of averaging at the central PDC based on a chosen delay threshold. We carry out simulations to show possible instabilities and sensitivities of the ADMM convergence on delay distribution parameters under these two averaging strategies. Our results exhibit a broad view of how the convergence of distributed estimation algorithms in physical processes depends strongly on the uncertainties in the underlying communications in a generic cyber-physical system. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract={Floating point multiplier is a key element in most digital applications such as filters, processors, embedded systems and control units. It is mainly used because of the need for a large dynamic range or in rapid prototyping applications where the actual number range has not been clearly specified. Hence increasing throughput of floating point multiplier is an issue to be taken into account. Asynchronous communication helps in increasing the throughput when the comparison is made with a synchronous system. Also usage of an higher radix multiplier design in the floating point datapath helps in increasing the efficiency of the design. Mantissa computation is the most critical part in floating point multiplication and hence efficient multiplier must be used to compute the same. A higher radix multiplier design is used to form a block in floating point datapath helps in increasing the efficiency of the design. Radix selection of the booth multiplier depends on the chosen IEEE format. For higher precision format there is a requirement for higher radix multiplier. For minimizing the disadvantages of higher radix multiplier design, an high speed adder can be used. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) systems process and respond to multiple (external) events, while performing computations for a Sense-Compute-Control (SCC) or a Sense-Only (SO) goal. Given the limitations of the interconnected resource-constrained devices, the execution environment can be based on an appropriate operating system for the IoT. The development effort can be reduced, when applications are built on top of RESTful web services, which can be shared and reused. However, the asynchronous communication between remote nodes is prone to event scheduling delays, which cannot be predicted and taken into account while programming the application. Long delays in message processing and communication, due to packet collisions, are avoided by carefully choosing the data transmission frequencies between the system's nodes. But even when specialized simulators are available, it is still a hard challenge to guarantee the functional and non-functional requirements at the application and system levels. In this article, we introduce a model-based rigorous analysis approach using the BIP component framework. We present a BIP model for IoT applications running on the Contiki OS. At the application level, we verify qualitative properties for service responsiveness requirements, whereas at the system level we can validate qualitative and quantitative properties using statistical model checking. We present results for an application scenario running on a distributed system infrastructure. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract={Today's distributed systems are commonly equipped with both synchronous and asynchronous components controlled with multiple clocks. The key challenges in designing such systems are (1) how to model multi-clocked local synchronous component, local asynchronous component, and asynchronous communication among components in a single framework. (2) how to ensure the correctness of model, and keep consistency between the model and the implementation of real system. In this paper, we propose a novel computation model named GalsBlock for the design of multi-clocked embedded system with both synchronous and asynchronous components. The computation model consists of several hierarchical compound and atom blocks communicating with data port connections. Each atom block can be refined as parallel mealy automata. The synchronous component can be captured in an atom block with the corresponding local control clock while the asynchronous component in an atom block without clock, and the asynchronous communications can be captured in the data port connections among blocks. The unified operational semantics and formal semantics are defined, which can be used for simulation and verification, respectively. Then, we can generate efficient VHDL code from the validated model, which can be synthesized into the FPGA processor for execution directly. We have developed the graphical modeling, simulation, verification, and code generation toolkit to support the computation model, and applied it in the design of a sub-system used in the real train communication control. © 1990-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={Distributed cyber-physical systems (DCPS), such as aeronautics and ground transportation systems, are very hard to design and verify, because of asynchronous communication, network delays, and clock skews. Their model checking verification typically becomes unfeasible due to the huge state space explosion caused by the system's concurrency. The Multirate PALS ("physically asynchronous, logically synchronous") methodology has been proposed to reduce the design and verification of a DCPS to the much simpler task of designing and verifying its underlying synchronous version, where components may operate with different periods. This paper presents a methodology for formally modeling and verifying multirate DCPSs using Multirate PALS. In particular, this methodology explains how to deal with the system's physical environment in Multirate PALS. We illustrate our methodology with a multirate DCPS consisting of an airplane maneuvered by a pilot, who turns the airplane to a specified angle through a distributed control system. Our formal analysis using Real-Time Maude revealed that the original design did not achieve a smooth turning maneuver, and led to a redesign of the system. We then use model checking and Multirate PALS to prove that the redesigned system satisfies the desired correctness properties, whereas model checking the corresponding asynchronous model is unfeasible. This shows that Multirate PALS is not only effective for formal DCPS verification, but can also be used effectively in the DCPS design process. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={Today's system-on-chip and distributed systems are commonly equipped with multiple clocks. The key challenge in designing such systems is that two situations have to be captured and evaluated in a single framework. The first is the heterogeneous control-oriented and data-oriented behaviors within one clock domain, and the second is the asynchronous communications between two clock domains. In this paper, we propose to use timed automata and synchronous dataflow to model the dynamic behaviors of the multiclock train-control system, and a multiprocessor architecture for the implementation from our model to the real system. Data-oriented behaviors are captured by synchronous dataflow, control-oriented behaviors are captured by timed automata, and asynchronous communications of the interclock domain can be modeled as an interface timed automaton or a synchronous dataflow module. The behaviors of synchronous dataflow are interpreted by some equivalent timed automata to maintain the semantic consistency of the mixed model. Then, various functional properties that are important to guarantee the correctness of the system can be simulated and verified within the framework. We apply the framework to the design of a control system described in the standard IEC 61 375 and several bugs are detected. The bugs in the standard have been fixed, and the new version has been implemented and used in the real-world subway communication control system. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract={We study the problem of credit-based adaptive polling in undirected arbitrary point-to-point asynchronous networks. Polling consists of two rounds, namely propagation (broadcast) and feedback (confirmation, response) rounds. By adaptive polling, a spanning tree of unknown topology is built dynamically during the propagation round, and feedback messages are free to choose their paths back to the initiator-a specific node who initiates the polling algorithm. The freedom in the feedback round relies on the use of credits in the propagation round. We re-visit three existing algorithms and analyse their average case communication bit complexities incurred by the credits in the propagation round, and these analyses match with the numerical results coming after. We also give an optimal lower bound on the worst case bit message complexity for the case when the number of nodes in the network is unknown. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract={In this paper, a distributed asynchronous algorithm for intelligent lighting is presented that minimizes collective power use while meeting multiple user lighting constraints simultaneously and requires very little communication among agents participating in the distributed computation. Consequently, the approach is arbitrarily scalable, adapts to exogenous disturbances, and is robust to failures of individual agents. This algorithm is an example of a decentralized primal-space algorithm for constrained non-linear optimization that achieves coordination between agents using stigmergic memory cues present in the physical system as opposed to explicit communication and synchronization. Not only does this work make of stigmergy, a property first used to describe decentralized decision making in eusocial insects, but details of the algorithm are inspired by classic social foraging theory and more recent results in eusocial-insect macronutrient regulation. This theoretical analysis in this paper guarantees that the decentralized stigmergically coupled system converges to within a finite neighborhood of the optimal resource allocation. These results are validated using a hardware implementation of the algorithm in a small-scale intelligent lighting scenario. There are other real-time distributed resource allocation applications that are amenable to these methods, like distributed power generation, in general, this paper means to provide proof of concept that physical variables in cyberphysical systems can be leveraged to reduce the communication burden of algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.},

The proposed method computes the time-difference of arrival of each transmitted signal to any pair of receiving nodes in order to get rid of the unknown transmission time. A range-based localization procedure is implemented: first a least-squares estimator is used to compute a set of pseudo-ranges involving the blind node, then an iterative least-squares method is used to localize the blind node. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is illustrated via simulations. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract={The key challenges of the model-driven approach to designing multi-clocked embedded systems are three-fold: (1) how to model local synchronous components and asynchronous communication between components in a single framework, (2) how to ensure the correctness of the model, and (3) how to maintain the consistency between the model and the implementation of the system. In this paper, we present Tsmart, a self-contained toolkit to address these three challenges. Tsmart seamlessly integrates (1) a graphical editor to facilitate the modeling of the complex behaviors and structures in an embedded system, (2) a simulator for interactive graphical simulation to understand and debug the system model, (3) a verification engine to verify the correctness of the system design, and (4) a synthesis engine to automatically generate efficient executable VHDL code from the model. The toolkit has been successfully applied to designing the main control system of a train communication controller, and the system has already been deployed and in operation. The evaluation of Tsmart on this real industrial application demonstrates the effectiveness and the potential of the toolkit. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

  abstract={The anticipated proliferation of smart devices, the 'Internet of Things' (IoT), is one of the motivations for some large-scale research efforts aiming to design a new Internet architecture. One such effort is Named-Data Networking (NDN) - a 'future internet architecture' research project in the Information-Centric Networking (ICN) area that emphasizes efficient, scalable and secure data distribution through a shift from the host-based addressing of IP to data-centric addressing. Because of its focus on data distribution, NDN has been assumed to be poorly suited for other networking scenarios. We address efficient and secure sensing over NDN, motivated by the convergence of the IoT vision with traditional Building Automation Systems (BAS). We consider several sensing paradigms and demonstrate the use of NDN to securely interact with NDN-enabled sensors. In the process, we address some challenges caused by sensors' intermittent availability, power constraints and asynchronous communication patterns. Our results include concrete protocols that facilitate secure sensor-bound communication over NDN. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract={Synchronous iterative algorithms are often less scalable than asynchronous iterative ones. Performing large scale experiments with different kind of network parameters is not easy because with supercomputers such parameters are fixed. So, one solution consists in using simulations first in order to analyze what parameters could influence or not the behavior of an algorithm. In this paper, we show that it is interesting to use SimGrid to simulate the behavior of asynchronous iterative algorithms. For that, we compare the behavior of a synchronous GMRES algorithm with an asynchronous multisplitting one with simulations which let us easily choose some parameters. Both codes are real MPI codes and simulations allow us to see when the asynchronous multisplitting algorithm can be more efficient than the GMRES one to solve a 3D Poisson problem. © 2014 IEEE.},

  abstract={With proliferation of Cloud technologies, the need for connecting wireless sensor networks to Cloud servers arose. With easy accessibility to the cloud and the increased processing power of cloud servers, it became possible to gather data from sensor networks at different locations and process large amount of sensor data. A new generation WSN gateways is needed for this purpose in order to connect the sensors to cloud servers. In this paper, a design and implementation method for RESTful WSN Gateways is proposed using a Javascript based framework, Node.js, which uses asynchronous programming model and can handle a large amount of network connections simultaneously. The gateway is designed as an Embedded Linux device, which can handle multiple accesses with both sensors and cloud servers. All communication APIs residing inside the gateway is designed to be RESTful, HTTP API for communication with cloud servers and Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) for sensor communication. The proposed approach in this paper provides seamless integration between cloud applications and sensors with its well-defined standard API and minimizes the development time of WSN gateways. © VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany.},

  abstract={The development of applications that adapt to the environment and remain running even when the user is moving or switching device, remains an open research challenge. In this article we present a view of the EXEHDA middleware and a new service created for dynamic adaptation. EXEHDA is service-oriented, adaptive and was conceived to support the execution of ubiquitous applications. The main concept in the proposed design for the middleware and for the application is context awareness expressed in an adaptive behavior. The middleware manages and implements the follow-me semantics for ubiquitous applications. This is also a key to provide functionality adapted to the constraints and unpredictability of the large-scale environment. To achieve this objective, EXEHDA employs various strategies in its services to allow the adaptation to the current context, such as on-demand adaptive service loading, and dynamic discovery and configuration. In that sense, EXEHDA provides services for distributed adaptive execution, context recognition, ubiquitous storage and access, and anonymous and asynchronous communications. To evaluate the new service proposed for dynamic adaptation we developed a case study, implementing an application in medical area. Analyzing the results we can see that the users found the application easy to use and usefulness for health workers at a hospital.

It employs GALS interfaces (syn- chronous to asynchronous/asynchronous to synchronous), imposing negligible area overhead to handle the Metasta- bility issue. It is synthesized with the help of Persia tool, resulting in 23165 transistors. The power consumption and delay factor have been evaluated by means of H-Spice toolset in 90nm manufacturing technology. According to the exper- imental results the proposed asynchronous design consumes less power than synchronous scheme by removing clock sig- nals. The imposed area overhead of asynchronous design is reported 36% higher than synchronous one. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

Because of the CPS' complex architecture, it may suffer from the state-space explosion problem when we verify CPS models by model checking methods. Therefore, we offer a method which models CPS with Component Services. The method treats the CPS components as a service provider, and models component services to further simplify the system's state-space.

  abstract={Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) is the primary method for enabling asynchronous communication over the Web. Although AJAX is providing warranted real-time capabilities to the Web, it requires unconventional programming methods at the expense of extensive resource usage. WebSockets, which is an emerging protocol, has the potential to address many challenges with implementing asynchronous communication over the Web. However, there has been no independent study that quantitatively compares AJAX and WebSockets.This paper therefore provides two contributions to integrating Web technologies in real-time systems. First, it provides an experience report for adding real-time monitoring support over the Web to the Open-source Architecture of Software Instrumentation of Systems (OASIS), which is an open-source real-time instrumentation middleware for distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems. Secondly, its quantitatively compares using AJAX and WebSockets to stream collected instrumentation data over the Web. Results from our study show that a WebSockets server consumes 50% less network bandwidth than an AJAX server; a WebSockets client consumes memory at constant rate, not at an increasing rate; and WebSockets can send up to 215.44% more data samples when consuming the same amount network bandwidth as AJAX. © 2013 IEEE.},

  abstract={Embedded systems are used in almost every domain of our daily life. Actual research and development activities focus on wireless connected and mobile system architectures. The resulting network topologies represent embedded, distributed systems, which are able to process complex tasks in a cooperative way. Here, most of the hardware platforms are energy self-sufficient with strongly limited resources. In consequence, the maximisation of the system runtime is essential to fulfil all application tasks as long as possible. Especially in long-term scenarios (e.g. WSN / SANET), the runtime depends on the efficiency of communication processes. Hence, the key challenge for researchers and engineers represents the application-specific integration of adapted communication concepts, radio technologies, and protocol stacks into an energy-efficient communication architecture. In this paper, we critically discuss energy efficiency in distributed, embedded systems with focus on the communication aspects. We introduce an easy to use estimation model for quantifying the energy efficiency on both local (system) and global (network) layer. The included cost functions consider the power consumption as well as timing aspects. In this context, we evaluate several optimisation strategies under real-world conditions within a heterogeneous network environment We integrate an asynchronous communication paradigm, wake-up-receiver technologies, and data aggregation techniques in a stepwise process. Accordingly, the respective analysis compares the results and clarifies the importance of an application-specific system design. If the communication architecture and the configuration scheme fits to the environmental conditions, significant optimisations for the energy efficiency are observable. © 2013 IFIP.},

  abstract={Distributed computing is at the heart of many applications. It arises as soon as one has to solve a problem in terms of entities - such as processes, peers, processors, nodes, or agents - that individually have only a partial knowledge of the many input parameters associated with the problem. In particular each entity cooperating towards the common goal cannot have an instantaneous knowledge of the current state of the other entities. Whereas parallel computing is mainly concerned with 'efficiency', and real-time computing is mainly concerned with 'on-time computing', distributed computing is mainly concerned with 'mastering uncertainty' created by issues such as the multiplicity of control flows, asynchronous communication, unstable behaviors, mobility, and dynamicity. While some distributed algorithms consist of a few lines only, their behavior can be difficult to understand and their properties hard to state and prove. The aim of this book is to present in a comprehensive way the basic notions, concepts, and algorithms of distributed computing when the distributed entities cooperate by sending and receiving messages on top of an asynchronous network. The book is composed of seventeen chapters structured into six parts: distributed graph algorithms, in particular what makes them different from sequential or parallel algorithms; logical time and global states, the core of the book; mutual exclusion and resource allocation; high-level communication abstractions; distributed detection of properties; and distributed shared memory. The author establishes clear objectives per chapter and the content is supported throughout with illustrative examples, summaries, exercises, and annotated bibliographies. This book constitutes an introduction to distributed computing and is suitable for advanced undergraduate students or graduate students in computer science and computer engineering, graduate students in mathematics interested in distributed computing, and practitioners and engineers involved in the design and implementation of distributed applications. The reader should have a basic knowledge of algorithms and operating systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013. All rights are reserved.},

  abstract={There is an ever-increasing need for exploring large-scale graph data sets in computational sciences, social networks, and business analytics. However, due to irregular and memory-intensive nature, graph applications are notoriously known for their poor performance on parallel computer systems. In this paper we propose a new hybrid MPI/Pthreads breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm featuring with (i) overlapping computation and communication by separating them into multiple threads, (ii) maximizing multi-threading parallelism on multi-cores with massive threads to improve throughputs, and (iii) exploiting pipeline parallelism using lock-free queues for asynchronous communication. By comparing it with traditional MPI-only BFS algorithm, we learned several valuable lessons that would help to understand and exploit parallelism in graph traversal applications. Experiments show our algorithm is 1.9× faster than the MPI-only version, capable of processing 1.45 billion edges per second on a 32-node SMP cluster. At a large scale, our algorithm is 1.49× than the MPI-only BFS algorithm in Combinatorial BLAS Library with 6,144 cores. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={High-level Petri net classes are suited to specify concurrent processes with emphasis both in control and data processing, making them appropriate to specify distributed embedded systems (DES). Embedded systems components are usually synchronous, which means that DES can be seen as Globally-Asynchronous Locally-Synchronous (GALS) systems. This paper proposes to include in high-level Petri nets a set of concepts already introduced for low-level Petri nets allowing the specification of GALS systems, namely time domains, test arcs and priorities. Additionally, this paper proposes external messages and three types of (high-level) asynchronous communication channels, to specify the interaction between distributed components based on message exchange. With these extensions, GALS-DES can be specified using high-level Petri nets. The resulting models include the specification of each component with well-defined boundaries and interface, and also the explicit specification of the asynchronous interaction between components. These models will be used not only to specify the system behavior, but also to be the input for model-checking tools (supporting its verification) and automatic code generation tools (supporting its implementation in software and hardware platforms), giving a contribution to the model-based development approach and hardware-software co-design of DES based on high-level Petri nets. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013},

  abstract={Flash memory has gained in popularity as storage devices for both enterprise and embedded systems because of its high performance, low energy and reduced cost. The endurance problem of flash memory, however, is still a challenge and is getting worse as storage density increases with the adoption of multi-level cells (MLC). Prior work has addressed wear leveling and data reduction, but there is significantly less work on using the file system to improve flash lifetimes. Some common mechanisms in traditional file systems, such as journaling, metadata synchronization, and page-aligned update, can induce extra write operations and aggravate the wear of flash memory. This problem is called write amplification from file systems. In order to mitigate write amplification, we propose an object-based flash translation layer design (OFTL), in which mechanisms are co-designed with flash memory. By leveraging page metadata, OFTL enables lazy persistence of index metadata and eliminates journals while keeping consistency. Coarse-grained block state maintenance reduces persistent free space management overhead. With byte-unit access interfaces, OFTL is able to compact and co-locate the small updates with metadata to further reduce updates. Experiments show that an OFTL-based system, OFSS, offers a write amplification reduction of 47.4%~89.4% in SYNC mode and 19.8% ~64.0% in ASYNC mode compared with ext3, ext2, and btrfs on an up-to-date page-level FTL. © 2016 Australian Society of Sugar Cane Technologists.

  abstract={Distributed cyber-physical systems (DCPS) are pervasive in areas such as aeronautics and ground transportation systems, including the case of distributed hybrid systems. DCPS design and verification is quite challenging because of asynchronous communication, network delays, and clock skews. Furthermore, their model checking verification typically becomes unfeasible due to the huge state space explosion caused by the system's concurrency. The PALS (“physically asynchronous, logically synchronous”) methodology has been proposed to reduce the design and verification of a DCPS to the much simpler task of designing and verifying its underlying synchronous version. The original PALS methodology assumes a single logical period, but Multirate PALS extends it to deal with multirate DCPS in which components may operate with different logical periods. This paper shows how Multirate PALS can be applied to formally verify a nontrivial multirate DCPS. We use Real-Time Maude to formally specify a multirate distributed hybrid system consisting of an airplane maneuvered by a pilot who turns the airplane according to a specified angle through a distributed control system. Our formal analysis revealed that the original design was ineffective in achieving a smooth turning maneuver, and led to a redesign of the system that satisfies the desired correctness properties. This shows that the Multirate PALS methodology is not only effective for formal DCPS verification, but can also be used effectively in the DCPS design process, even before properties are verified. © K.

  abstract={In a dynamic environment, one of the challenges in building context aware applications is the communication paradigm between context providers and end applications. Synchronous communication may not be suitable since all the entities may not be live all the time. In this paper we present the architecture of Context Aware Framework developed using publish / subscribe paradigm to provide asynchronous communication between sensor layer which provides the context information and application layer which consumes the context in order to act according to the context. Sensors keep publishing the data in the XML format using Publish-API and Applications subscribe to the interested context using Subscribe-API. The framework also maintains a knowledge base to store context information in OWL (Web Ontology Language) format and does context interpretation, context modeling, rule based reasoning and event notification. It helps in rapid development of context aware applications across various domains. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={OSGi is a popular Java-based platform, which has its roots in the area of embedded systems. However, nowadays it is used more and more in enterprise systems. To fit this new application area, OSGi has recently been extended with the Remote Services specification. This specification enables distribution, which OSGi was previously lacking. However, the specification provides means for synchronous communication only and leaves out asynchronous communication. As an attempt to fill a gap in this field, we propose, implement and evaluate an approach for the integration of asynchronous messaging into OSGi.},

  abstract={We present some unique challenges in cognitive radio ad-hoc networks (CRAHNs) that are not present in conventional single-channel or multi-channel wireless ad-hoc networks. We first briefly survey these challenges and their potential impact on the design of efficient algorithms for several fundamental problems in CRAHNs. Then, we describe our recent contributions to the capacity maximization problem~\cite{capacity-mass} and the connectivity problem~\cite{connectivity-algosensors}. The capacity maximization problem is to maximize the overall throughput utility among multiple unicast sessions, the connectivity problem is to find a connected subgraph from the given cognitive radio network where each secondary node is equipped with multiple radios. By assuming the physical interference model and asynchronous communications, we reformulate the above two problems where the capacity maximization problem is to find the maximum number of simultaneously transmitting links in secondary networks, and the connectivity problem is to construct a spanning tree over secondary networks using the fewest timeslots. We discuss the challenging issues for designing distributed approximation algorithms and give a preliminary framework for solving these two problems. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={In this paper we present a view of EXEHDA middleware and a novel service created for dynamic adaptation. EXEHDA is service-oriented, adaptive and was conceived to support the execution of ubiquitous applications. The main concept in the proposed design for the middleware and for the application is context awareness expressed in an adaptive behavior. The middleware manages and implements the follow-me semantics for ubiquitous applications. This is also a key to provide functionality adapted to the constraints and unpredictability of the large-scale environment. EXEHDA provides services for distributed adaptive execution, context recognition, ubiquitous storage and access, and anonymous and asynchronous communications. To evaluate the proposed service we developed a case study, implementing an application in medical area. Analyzing the results we can see that the users found the application easy to use and usefulness for health workers at a hospital. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={Systems of systems (SoS) are composed of subsystems such as Distributed, Information Technology, Real-Time and Embedded systems. Among distributed systems, Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM) is used by SoS in order to share status information from system elements (component, service, etc.). Often several different MOM technologies are used in one SoS, then interoperability between these MOM is a requirement. In this paper, we present R-MOM, a component-based framework for interoperable and adaptive asynchronous middleware systems. R-MOM provides a reflective component architecture where one MOM functionality is embedded into one component which is modifiable at run-time. Loosely-coupling between reflective components permits to get a fined-personalization of MOM functionalities, such as protocol, encoding rule, Quality of Services (QoS) processing, data production/consumption, description, routing and filtering. Interoperability between integrated protocol functionalities is a consequence of architecture design. R-MOM interoperates with different kinds of MOM, from distributed message queues (Java Message Service, Advanced Message Queueing Protocol, 0MQ) to content-based publish/subscribe systems (OMG's Data Distribution Service). This paper describes the architectural concepts of the R-MOM framework, discusses its implementation, and evaluates its interoperability capability. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={In this paper we examine a popular network computational model (BSP: Bulk Synchronous Parallel) that has been adopted by the Google Pregel system to support large scale graph processing. We show that the synchronicity assumption made by the BSP model, while acceptable in data center like environments with strong and persistent network connectivity, can result in severe performance penalties in the context of dynamic networks. We introduce a new computational model (BAP: Bulk Asynchronous Parallel) that preserves the bulk and parallel nature of the BSP model but extends the model to asynchronous network communication. We consider two popular classes of graph queries (random walk queries and shortest path queries), present both BSP and BAP algorithms for these queries and evaluate their performance using realistic graphs datasets (DBLP and Flickr) and dynamic network datasets (Infocom06 and MIT Reality dataset). Our initial results show that in dynamic networks BAP algorithms can achieve several orders of magnitude in improvement for various QoI metrics such as accuracy and latency of (partial and complete) query evaluation. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract={On recent years, the educational paradigm of electrical and computer engineering has undergone a significant transformation with the advent and the exploitation of computer and communication technologies. Such transformation was necessitated in order to harmonize the learning process with the needs of the daily life. As a result, E-learning has been adopted and has added two major aspects to the learning process: 1) Interactivity; owing to the integration of simulation and multimedia technologies. 2) Ubiquity; owing to the integration of synchronous and asynchronous communication tools, and remote laboratories. Thereby, thanks to E-learning students incentives toward learning have increased. There is no doubt that practical sessions have an intrinsic role in electrical and computer engineering education; they augment the learning outcomes by strengthening the understanding of scientific concepts and theories. However, cost and administration burdens have hindered the adoption of practical sessions in engineering education until the appearance of remote laboratories. Remote laboratories have tackled these concerns by bringing practical sessions online and providing workbenches unconstrained by neither geographical nor time considerations. For these reasons, remote laboratories have proliferated among many universities and institutes around the world to be adopted in most of the disciplines of electrical and computer engineering curricula. A study carried out by the authors deduced that most of the developed remote laboratories around the world are based on common prototypes that are subsets of a common architecture, which is going to be the main topic of this paper. The paper reports on the common prototypes of today's remote laboratories for electrical and computer engineering education and addresses the most outstanding developments for the multidisciplinary applications that are based on such prototypes. These applications encompass embedded systems (e.g. Programmable Logic Devices (PLD) and microcontrollers), Digital Signal Processing (DSP), instrumentation and measurements, automation (e.g. Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)), machinery control, and others. The aim of this study is to foster the dissemination of remote laboratories in the learning process with regarding to the recommendation of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and to foster, as well, the globalization of engineering education by pointing out the remarkable achievement in the remote experimentation field. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.},

  abstract={NFC is a wireless technology that allows software to interact with RFID tags and that is increasingly integrated into smartphones and other mobile devices. In this paper, we present MORENA: a middleware that treats NFC-enabled programs as distributed object-oriented programs in which RFID tags are represented as intermittently connected remote objects. We draw inspiration from the ambient-oriented programming paradigm to represent these objects as first-class remote references which only offer asynchronous communication with the tag to which they refer. This allows the programmer to implement mobile applications that read from or write to RFID tags without having to handle every single fault manually and without blocking the entire application during read or write operations. We built MORENA on top of the Android platform and evaluated our abstractions by implementing a representative application running on NFC-enabled Android phones using MORENA. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract={Innovation in cyber-physical systems is today largely driven by embedded software. Thus, appropriate approaches have to be employed to handle the complexity that results from the multi-discipline nature of these innovative cyberphysical systems. Modelica as modeling language specifically targets these multi-discipline systems. The UML profile ModelicaML combines the graphical notation of the UML with the sound formal modeling provided by Modelica. ModelicaML currently does not support modeling asynchronous communication which is increasingly required when cyber-physical systems have to coordinate their behavior. In this paper, we present our approach for Modelica code generation from ModelicaML state machines which have been extended by asynchronous communication. We illustrate our approach by an extended two tanks system that contains two distributed controllers which coordinate themselves by message exchange.},

  abstract={The goal of the CARUS project is to demonstrate the effective operation of a swarm of UAVs. The objective is to keep under surveillance a given set of points of interest where incidents (such as a fire) can arise. Each individual UAV operates in an autonomous manner and the decisions are taken by each aircraft in the air rather than on the ground, based on asynchronous communication between vessels. These local decisions impact the whole swarm behavior. It should be noted that we are not addressing formation flights; we are dealing with groups of UAVs the goal of which is to cooperatively achieve a common mission. CARUS relies on the research activities carried out at the Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en Informatique (LaBRI) in the domain of secure swarms of autonomous mobile communicating terminals. It both takes advantage of the results of this research and contributes to some of its activities, among which a PhD funded by the DGA (Direction Géné rale de l'Armement). CARUS uses SCUAL - pronounce [skwal]- which is a swarm of five UAVs (fig. 1) acquired thanks to a funding by the MIB Carnot. It also relies on the UAV and ground station expertise of the Fly-n-Sense company and the support of Thales in terms of program methodology and of software for ground visualization of the swarm operation. CARUS is a LaBRI project, conducted in the framework of the Albatros GIS (Groupement d'Intérêt Scientifique), with the support of the Région Aquitaine, its UAV Cluster and Bordeaux TechnoWest. The goal of this paper is to give an overview of the CARUS demonstrator. Its development has raised several major issues that not only relate to distributed algorithms and embedded systems, but also to regulatory rules and safety procedures. The key point is that the target platform is a swarm of autonomous vessels and not a single UAV; it must thus be dealt with as a whole. For instance, when a member of the swarm has to be landed for security reasons, the other UAVs must be moved away from the landing path so as to avoid collisions. These are new problems that did not exist when one single vessel was classically considered. © 2011 IEEE.},

  abstract={OSGi is a popular Java-based platform that was originally intended for embedded systems. But today OSGi is used more and more in enterprise systems. To fit this new application area, OSGi is continuously extended by the OSGi Enterprise Expert Group (EEG). For example, recently, support for remote services has been added to OSGi. But this support implies only synchronous communication of remote services, thus limiting the application of OSGi in the area of enterprise systems, as enterprise systems typically embody both synchronous and asynchronous communication. To fill this gap, we propose a novel approach to integrating asynchronous communication into OSGi.},

  abstract={With the widespread use of embedded system, efficient and low-power designs have become crucial. The increasing scale of circuits leads to many problems in traditional synchronous designs. Asynchronous circuits use handshake signals to control communications between different modules, resolving problems caused by global clock. In order to implement full-asynchronous communications between asynchronous devices, this paper studies key techniques about asynchronous bus and implements an asynchronous bus, Pipeline-based Asynchronous bus for low energy (PABLE). We propose an asynchronous pipeline structure to improve bus's performance and research the asynchronous arbitration circuit to provide a stable and efficient asynchronous mechanism. Experimental results show that, for a single transfer, the read or write latency of PABLE would be lower than synchronous bus in the case of more than 60%. The average power consumption of PABLE decreases by 41% compared with synchronous bus. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

  abstract={The task level of a program is the maximum number of tasks that can be available (i.e., not finished nor suspended) simultaneously during its execution for any input data. Static knowledge of the task level is of utmost importance for understanding and debugging parallel programs as well as for guiding task schedulers. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first static analysis which infers safe and precise approximations on the task level for a language with async-finish parallelism. In parallel languages, async and finish are basic constructs for, respectively, spawning tasks and waiting until they terminate. They are the core of modern, parallel, distributed languages like X10. Given a (parallel) program, our analysis returns a task-level upper bound, i.e., a function on the program's input arguments that guarantees that the task level of the program will never exceed its value along any execution. Our analysis provides a series of useful (over)approximations, going from the total number of tasks spawned in the execution up to an accurate estimation of the task level. Copyright © 2011 ACM.},

In highly decoupled environments, it is required to introduce software paradigms that adjust well to this degree of independence among subsystems. In modern NES, real-time properties and reconfiguration facilities are not only an added value but an unavoidable trend that research is currently focusing at. Service-oriented architectures (SOA) are an easy-to-understand natural means to provide such decoupled model of operation; service-based applications are made of a set of self-contained pieces of functionality (services) that cooperate by exchanging messages to provide the application's common goal. This paper presents a middleware architecture that includes real-time support for service-oriented NES. The architecture includes the fundamental set of functions to support timely service-based composition and execution. The architecture is the core part of the iLAND project that aims at supporting deterministic service-based composition and reconfiguration in service-based NES. The architecture can be built on top standard communication middleware cores (as DDS or RT-CORBA), since it supports synchronous and asynchronous communication models. An experimental set up for real-time video transmission has been developed to validate it. ©2010 IEEE.},

  abstract={In asynchronous communication system, such as MANET or uplink of CDMA system, MAI (Multiple Access Interference) is a problem that cannot be ignored. To suppress the effect of MAI, this paper introduces a new mix-carrier method in asynchronous CDMA system. The proposed method uses both cosine and Chirp as carriers, by using frequency domain filter and Fractional Fourier domain filter at the receiver to suppress MAI. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method reduces MAI effectively, and with the increase of spreading sequence length, user number and the maximum time delay between different users, the BER improvement is more significant. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel concept of "Memory Ubiquitous" which provides smart memory functions for appliances, facilities, and equipments used in everyday life. At the first step to realize it, we first propose three fundamental functions. These are capturing and recording the surrounding scene including human behaviors, annotating and editing the records to construct smart memories, and presenting the integrated memories. These functions can support human activities by aiding recall, giving instructions, and providing asynchronous communications. We chose a kitchen as an actual test bed and built a prototype cooking support system with the above smart memory functions. We implemented a context-sensitive record presentation based on state recognition and simultaneous display of multiple records that is adaptive to users' intentions. By evaluating the system's performance, we obtained several results that show how smart memory functions can assist human activities and how they can be extended for more useful services. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract={The demand for software in Ubiquitous Computing, in which access to applications occurs anywhere, anytime and from different devices, has raised new challenges for Software Engineering. One of these challenges is related to the adaptation of the contents of an application to the numerous devices that can access it in distinct contexts. Another challenge is related to the building of rich interfaces with multimedia content, asynchronous communication and other features that characterize Rich Internet Applications (RIAs). Searching for solutions focused on these challenges, a model-driven process for building rich interfaces of context-sensitive ubiquitous applications has been developed. The process, which is based on the conceptions of Domain-Specific Modeling (DSM), emphasizes the modeling reuse from a rich interface components metamodel. This metamodel provides a generic infrastructure for developing rich interfaces of applications, focusing on model-level reuse and on code generation for different Ubiquitous Computing platforms. In addition, the metamodel allows that the interface models are built by using the terms of rich interface domain, which facilitates the communication between users and developers.

  abstract={There are two avenues for many-core machines to gain higher performance: increasing the number of processors, and increasing the number of vector units in one SIMD processor. A truly scalable algorithm should take advantage of both. However, most past research on scalable memory allocators scales well with the number of processors, but poorly with the number of vector units in one SIMD processor. As a result, they are not truly scalable on many-core architectures. In this work, we introduce our proposed solution through the design of XMalloc, a truly scalable, efficient lock-free memory allocator. We will present (1) our solution for transforming traditional atomic compare-and-swap based lock-free algorithm to scale on SIMD architectures, and (2) a hierarchical cache-like buffer solution to reduce the average latency of accesses to non-scalable or slow resources such as main memory in a many-core machine. We implemented XMalloc as a memory allocator on an NVIDIA Tesla C1060 GPU with 240 processing units. Our experimental results show that XMalloc scales very well with growth in both the number of processors and the number of vector units in each SIMD processor. Our truly scalable lock-free solution achieves 211 times speedup compared to the common lock-free solution. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract={Power consumption of on-chip interconnects is a primary concern for many embedded system-on-chip (SoC) applications. In this paper, we compare energy and performance characteristics of asynchronous (clockless) and synchronous network-on-chip implementations, optimized for a number of SoC designs. We adapted the COSI-2.0 framework with ORION 2.0 router and wire models for synchronous network generation. Our own tool, ANetGen, specifies the asynchronous network by determining the topology with simulated-annealing and router locations with force-directed placement. It uses energy and delay models from our 65 nm bundled-data router design. SystemC simulations varied traffic burstiness using the self-similar b-model. Results show that the asynchronous network provided lower median and maximum message latency, especially under bursty traffic, and used far less router energy with a slight overhead for the inter-router wires. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract={Lua is a scripting language used in many industrial applications, with an emphasis on embedded systems and games. Two key points in the design of the language that led to its widely adoption are flexibility and small size. To achieve these two conflicting goals, the design emphasizes the use of few but powerful mechanisms, such as first-class functions, associative arrays, coroutines, and reflexive capabilities. As a consequence of this design, although Lua is primarily a procedural language, it is frequently used in several different programming paradigms, such as functional, object-oriented, goal-oriented, and concurrent programming, and also for data description. In this paper we discuss what mechanisms Lua features to achieve its flexibility and how programmers use them for different paradigms. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

  abstract={To support model-based development and analysis of embedded systems, the specification language VDM++ has been extended with asynchronous communication and improved timing primitives. In addition, we have defined an interface for the co-simulation of a VDM++ model with a continuous-time model of its environment. This enables multi-disciplinary design space exploration and continuous validation of design decisions throughout the development process. We present an operational semantics which formalizes the precise meaning of the VDM extensions and the co-simulation concept. © 2010 Springer.},

  abstract={This paper presents the design of distributed embedded systems using the synchronous multiclock model of the Signal language. It proposes a methodology that ensures a correct-by-construction functional implementation of these systems from high-level models. It shows the capability of the synchronous approach to apply formal techniques and tools that guarantee the reliability of the designed systems. Such a capability is necessary and highly worthy when dealing with safety-critical systems. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study consisting of a simple avionic application, which aims to pragmatically help the reader to understand the manipulated formal concepts, and to apply them easily in order to solve system correctness issues encountered in practice. The application functionality is first modeled as well as its distribution on a generic hardware architecture. This relies on the endochrony and endo-isochrony properties of Signal specifications, defined previously. The considered architectures include asynchronous communication mechanisms, which are also modeled in Signal and proved to achieve message exchanges correctly. Furthermore, the synchronizability of the different parts in the resulting system is addressed after its deployment on a specific execution platform with multirate clocks. After all these steps, a distributed code can be automatically generated. © 2010 IEEE.},

  abstract={The ongoing OMG standard on the “Semantics of a Foundational Subset for Executable UML Models” identifies a subset of UML (called fUML, for Foundational UML), for which it defines a general-purpose execution model. This execution model therefore captures an executable semantics for fUML, providing an unambiguous basis for various kinds of model-based exploitations (model transformation, code generation, analysis, simulation, debugging etc.). This kind of facility is of great interest for the domain of real time systems, where analysis of system behavior is very sensible. One may therefore wonder if the general-purpose execution model of fUML can be used to reflect execution semantics concerns of real-time systems (e. g., concurrency, synchronization, and scheduling.). It would practically mean that it is possible to leverage on this precise semantic foundation (and all the work that its definition implied) to capture the precise execution semantics of real-time systems. In this paper, we show that this approach is not directly feasible, because of the way concurrency and asynchronous communications are actually handled in the fUML execution model. However, we show that introducing support for these aspects is technically feasible and reasonable in terms of effort and we propose lightweight modifications of the Execution model to illustrate our purpose. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2010.},

This paper proposed an embedded XML data exchange framework for asynchronous communication between different e-commerce systems. The XML data is used to exchange the e-commerce data between the customers and the special e-commerce system. The XML data is embedded into mail messages and delivered to the merchants by STMP protocol and received from the mail server by POP3 protocol and transformed to the e-commerce data items which can be recognized by the e-commerce systems. The embedded XML data exchange framework can realize the asynchronous data exchange and data flow management for ecommerce system. It can satisfy the demand of swift flexibility on the business logic. It is suitable for exchanging the ecommerce data asynchronously with low development cost. © 2009 IEEE.},

The ability to efficiently validate such algorithms in hardware is critical, yet challenging due to their decentralised nature.

We present the design and implementation of a custom hardware-in-the-loop simulator consisting of 27 embedded units with wireless communication and a special gateway device for interfacing with a desktop computer.

  abstract={Main requirement of recent computing environments, like mobile and then ubiquitous computing, is to adapt applications to context. On the other hand, access control generally trust users once they have authenticated, despite the fact that they may reach unauthorized situations. We analyse how dynamic information can be used to improve security in the authorization process, especially in the case of asynchronous communications, like messaging or eventing. We experiment and validate our approach using context as an authorization factor for eventing in Web service for device (like UPnP or DPWS).

  abstract={Architecture Analysis and Design Language (AADL) is used to describe the hardware and software architectures of embedded applications at the system level. The implementation of such systems is often distributed across asynchronous communication infrastructures. Such a distributed system is usually composed of locally synchronous processes communicating in a globally asynchronous manner, a GALS system. Yet, in a step-wise refinement based approach, one would prefer to model, simulate and validate such a system in a synchronous programming framework, and then automatically generate its GALS implementation. In this paper, we present a methodology to implement such an approach using the polychronous (multiclocked synchronous) model of computation of the data-flow synchronous language SIGNAL. We show how to model partially asynchronous application and to generate distributed simulation code starting from system-level AADL specifications.},

  abstract={An investigation into an effective and low-complexity adaptive routing strategy based on stochastic principles for an asynchronous network-on-chip platform that includes dynamically reconfigurable computing nodes is presented. The approach is compared with classic deterministic routing and it is shown to have good properties in terms of throughput and excellent fault-tolerance capabilities. The challenge of how to deliver reliability is one of the problems that multiprocessor system architects and manufactures will face as feature sizes and voltage supplies shrink and deep-submicron effects reduce the ability to carry out deterministic computing. It is likely that a new type of deep-submicron complex multicore systems will emerge which will be required to deliver high performance within strict energy and area budgets and operate over unreliable silicon. Within this context, the paper studies an on-chip communication infrastructure suitable for these systems. © 2008 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

  abstract={One of the challenges in designing distributed, embedded systems is the paucity of formal, executable specification notations that provide support for both real-time and asynchronous communication. This paper describes a timed architecture design language (Timed Architecture Interaction Diagrams or TAID) that, by virtue of its formal, executable semantics, combines the benefits of synchronous specification notations with the advantages of traditional architecture description languages. In addition, TAID provides support for a variety of temporal inter-process communication (IPC) primitives as a native feature of the language, so that the encapsulated communication behavior (captured by real-time "buses" in TAID) may be re-used across designs and serve as specifications for more detailed model implementations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we design and implement the secure event service for providing a secure ubiquitous computing environment. The Secure Event Service implemented in this paper enables users to perform content-based event retrieval, and supports only eligible event consumer and event producer to publish and receive events through the secure event service. The SPKI/SDSI certificate is used for supporting authentication and authorization in the secure event service. In order to provide content-based event retrieval, an asynchronous communication between event producers and consumers, and a disconnectedness support for mobile devices, we modify and expand the JavaSpace package. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

  abstract={Event-driven paradigms have become the leading model for large classes of applications and environments. In particular, pervasive, ubiquitous and grid computing, in which services dynamically plug in and get out, rely on middleware services that use communication channels and events to integrate and coordinate application-level services. This paper presents an advanced asynchronous communication service, which is a core component of Middleware for Pervasive Grids (MiPeG), a middleware platform for pervasive grid environments. This service handles hierarchies of classes of events. In particular, events are grouped into classes, which can be related in hierarchies. Producers and consumers can subscribe to the communication service for one or more classes; i.e., a consumer that subscribes to a class receives all the events of that class and of any hierarchically higher class. © 2008, Inderscience Publishers.},

  abstract={This paper presents a context-aware coordination model called USCM , ubiquitous semantic coordination model. Our model accompanies with the generic coordination model (XCM) [2]. XCM comes within P.Ciancarini's approach [1] and the vision of coordination proposed by T.Malone [1]. Ubiquitous Computing poses the challenge of increased communication, context-awareness, context-sensitivity and functionality. In order to meet out the challenge of increased communication USCM has chosen the coordination media to be Ubiquitous Semantic Space, a Distributed Space-based computing. Ubiquitous Semantic Space provides asynchronous communication, data persistence and context-awareness. USCM Model introduces a new pattern called Access-Oriented Space Pattern as a communication mechanism which is also modeled for contextual information. Contexts are represented using Ontology Web Language, OWL to provide context-awareness and context-sensitivity. The model is designed to express reactive behavior, by writing rules in SWRL and fired using JESS reasoner. It is also designed for discovery and composition of semantic services. we have demonstrated our model through an ubiquitous application, e-assisted living for the aged.},

  abstract={In pervasive computing environment a number of distributed applications asynchronously exchange data using the event-based mechanism. The OMG defined CORBA Event Service for asynchronous messaging, which provides a flexible channel for asynchronous communication among the distributed and collocated objects. In the existing Event Service channels are created manually by the developers or users to process and disseminate the events. Also, the channel management is static which may cause bottleneck in some channels. In this paper, thus, we propose a dynamic context-based channel management scheme by efficiently combining name service with event service. It is embedded in the CALM(Component-based Autonomic Layered Middleware) developed by us, which has been implemented based on ORB. Computer simulation reveals that the proposed approach significantly reduces the event delivery and processing time of the existing omni Event Service and TIBCO. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract={Ubiquitous Computing poses the challenge of increased communication, context-awareness and functionality. In a highly dynamic and weekly connected ubiquitous environment, continuous access to the network (synchronous communication) is very difficult. So it's necessary to go for tuple space which provides asynchronous communication without any loss in data. Tuple space offers a coordination infrastructure for communication between autonomous entities by providing a logically shared memory along with data persistence, transactional security as well as temporal and spatial decoupling properties that make it desirable for distributed systems [2] such as Ubiquitous Computing. In order to automate the task and the system to be intelligent, context awareness is a must. This can be achieved by using semantic web technology. Existing middleware's for Ubiquitous computing concentrates on RPC communication paradigm and deals with context-awareness separately. In our approach of constructing the middleware we provide common solution to both communication and context-awareness using Ubiquitous Semantic Space. Ubiquitous Semantic Space [S] brings together tuple space, semantic web technologies and ubiquitous Computing. Hence in this paper, we introduce a context-aware and co-ordination middleware framework for Ubiquitous Environment using Ubiquitous Semantic Space. Ubiquitous Semantic Space uses ontologies to define the semantics of various concepts. Using ontologies facilitates different agents in the environments to have a common semantic understanding of different contexts. Ontology is represented using Ontology Web Language, OWL [6]. We have modeled a Ubiquitous Semantic Space ontology structure suitable for communicating conceptual information among the agents. Our model also incorporates context-triggered action which is more useful for real-time ubiquitous application having reactive behavior. For enabling context-triggered action, our model has reactive space into Ubiquitous Semantic Space. Reactive Space, stores rules written in SWRL [22], Semantic Web Rule Language and fired using JESS [3] reasoner at the appropriate time. The middleware could easily adapt to changes in the environment. The structure of the Ubiquitous Semantic Space is designed in a fashion to have privacy among the communicating devices and the agents. Hence our middleware uses a decentralized architecture which supports asynchronous communication, context-awareness, context-sensitive communication, Privacy sensitive, adaptive to context-changes and reactive to emergency situation. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract={Asynchronous data communication mechanisms (ACMs) have been extensively studied as data connectors between independently timed processes in digital systems. In previous work, systematic ACM synthesis methods have been proposed. In this paper, we advance this work by developing algorithms and software tools which automate most of the ACM synthesis process. Firstly, an interleaving specification is constructed in the form of a state graph, and secondly, a Petri net model of an "ACM-type" is derived using the theory of regions. The method is applied to a number of "standard" writing and reading policies of ACMs with shared memory and unidirectional control variables.},

  abstract={The cxlib multitasking library is written for teaching embedded microprocessor principles to electrical and computer engineering students, serving as a stepping stone toward real time operating systems. The students also use cxlib in their projects. The library supports cooperative multitasking and a recent change allows for preemptive round-robin scheduling. The cxlib library was first written during the spring 2002 semester as the author surveyed the literature for material to use in a new course. The intent of the cxlib library is to provide simple multitasking that students themselves can use to develop example intermediate systems. The library is intentionally Spartan, giving ample wiggle room for adding features or making significant architectural changes. The cxlib library is currently written for the Freescale 68HC12 microprocessor using the Metrowerks CodeWarrior tool chain, but it should be portable to other systems. As a teaching tool, cxlib can be introduced in three hours of lecture time. In presenting cxlib there typically is a lively discussion regarding what is meant by context. The library is nearly transparent, helping students to see the workings of a context switch. Unlike a simple loop structure, cxlib provides a means to dynamically create and destroy tasks. Also cxlib can serve as a vehicle to introduce advanced concepts such as semaphores. The cxlib library is noncommercial open-source software. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2007.},

  abstract={Grid computing may offer the potential for compute intensive simulations of systems and processes such as those associated with Computational Fluid Dynamics and protein design. Such potential is arguably difficult to realize due to some challenging issues associated with distributed computing systems; including latency, asynchronous communication, and the ubiquity of faults. Various research efforts have been focused on developing grid architectures and mechanisms to minimize the effect of latency and improve the fault-tolerance of resource management systems. In this respect, this paper describes a grid simulation platform geared towards the minimization of the effect of latency through an integration of the domain decomposition approach to process simulation with a chosen neighborhood-based grid architecture. The operation of the proposed platform is illustrated through an experimental simulation of a two dimensional diffusion process.},

  abstract={The prevailing paradigm in the regime of resource-constrained embedded devices is event-driven programming. It offers a lightweight yet powerful concurrency model without multiple stacks resulting in reduced memory usage compared to multi-threading. However, event-driven programs need to be implemented as explicit state machines, often with no or limited support from the development tools, resulting in ad-hoc and unstructured code that is error-prone and hard to debug. This paper presents TinyVT, an extension of the nesC language that provides a virtual threading abstraction on top of the event-driven execution model of TinyOS with minimal penalty in memory usage. TinyVT employs a simple continuation mechanism to permit blocking wait, thus allowing split-phase operations within C control structures without relying on multiple stacks. Furthermore, it provides fine-grained scoping of variables shared between event handlers resulting in safer code and allowing for optimizations in compile-time memory allocation. TinyVT source code is mapped to nesC with a source-to-source translator, using synchronous communicating state machines as an intermediate representation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

  abstract={The Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) paradigm is emerging as a solution for the communication of SoCs. Many NoC architecture propositions are presented but few works on testing these network architectures. To test the SoCs, the main challenge is to reach into the embedded cores (i.e, the IPs). In this case, the DFT techniques that integrate test architectures into the SoCs to ease the test of these SoCs are really favoured. In this paper, we present a new methodology for testing NoC architectures. A modular, generic, scalable and configurable DFT architecture is developed in order to ease the test of NoC architectures. The target of this test architecture is asynchronous NoC architectures that are implemented in GALS systems. The proposed architecture is therefore named ANoC-TEST and is implemented in QDI asynchronous circuits. In addition, this architecture can be used to test the computing resources of the networked SoCs. Some initial results and conclusions are also given. © 2006 IEEE.},

The programming paradigm inherent in our scheme is a combination of FSM (finite state machines) and coroutines with multiple entry points. It brings about a unique flavor of multitasking suitable and appropriate for expressing both event driven simulation models as well as executable, multithreaded, embedded systems.

  abstract={HIJA is an undertaking to create the technology conditions that will allow architecture neutrality for real-time systems (ANRTS). This paper makes the point that technology features are needed at both the execution level (platform) and the software engineering level (process). In order to cope with the wide range of real-time and embedded systems, 3 run-time profiles based on RTSJ are identified, the hard real-time Java profile, the soft real-time Java profile, and the flexible real-time Java profile. These profiles also provide support for distributed applications based on both synchronous and asynchronous communication methods. In order to ensure that executing applications are functionally correct and satisfy resource constraints, a required tool set is described, including analysis tools for schedule-ability or functional correctness verification. Finally, results from a proof-of-concept implementation of ANRTS platforms and tool set, and their use for three different applications (avionics, automotive telematics, ambient system) are reported, confirming the feasibility of the ANRTS approach.

  abstract={This work addresses the problem of power consumption in networks-on-chip (NoCs). It investigates the reduction of dynamic power consumption through the reduction of transition activity using data coding techniques. Power macromodels for various NoC modules were built, allowing the estimation of the power consumption as a function of the transition activity at each module's inputs. Such macromodels were embedded in a system model and a series of simulations were performed, aiming to analyze the trade-off between the power savings due to coding techniques versus the power consumption overhead due to the encoding and decoding modules. A network-on-chip (NoC) is an infrastructure essentially composed of routers interconnected by communication channels. It is suitable to support the GALS paradigm, since it provides asynchronous communication, high scalability, reusability and reliability [1][2]. The growing market for portable battery-powered devices adds a third dimension (power) to the previously two-dimensional (speed, area) VLSI design space [3]. NoCs are not particularly efficient in power consumption. They solve the problem of high capacitances in wires and, consequently, the power consumption in long lines, but on the other hand the power consumed by the router modules is not negligible. The dynamic power consumption in a NoC grows linearly with the amount of bit transitions in subsequent data packets sent through the interconnect architecture. Using the Hermes NoC architecture [4] as a case study we could show that bit transitions affect the dynamic power consumption by as much as 6400% for interconnect lines, 180% for router input buffers and 20% for router control logic. Based on such results, this paper addresses the hypothesis that the power dissipation on a NoC-based system can be reduced by encoding the data sent through the network with coding schemes that reduce the average number of signal transitions [5]. Several such schemes were proposed in the late 90's, all of them addressing bus-based communication architectures. The contribution of this work is on the evaluation of such schemes in the context of NoC-based systems and on the trade-off analysis of the power savings obtained by the application of such coding schemes versus the power consumption overhead due to the additional encoding and decoding circuitry. In Networks-on-chip, the data is transmitted in packets which are sent through routers, from one source to one target core. Encoding and decoding operations must be done in the source and target cores only, so to convert the original data to the encoded (and transmitted) one and vice-versa. In this work the encoder and decoder modules were inserted in the local ports of the routers, that is, between the integrated cores and the NoC interconnect structure. For the latest CMOS technologies, static power accounts for the smallest part of the overall consumption. Accordingly, this work focuses only on NoC dynamic power consumption, using it as an objective function to evaluate the quality of data encoding schemes. Dynamic power consumption is proportional to the switching activity arising from packets moving across the network. Interconnect wires and routers dissipate dynamic power. Several authors have proposed to estimate NoC power consumption by evaluating the effect of bits/packets traffic on each NoC component. Average power per hop1 (APH) is used here to denote the average dynamic power consumption in a single hop of a packet transmitted over the NoC. APH can be split into three components: average power consumed by a router comprised of buffers, router wires and logic gates for switching (APR); average power consumed on a link between routers (APL); and average power consumed on a link between the router and the system core attached directly to it (APC). Equation (1) gives the average power consumption of a packet transmitted through a router, a local link and a link between routers. (1) APH = APR + APL + APC Moreover, our analysis showed that a better understanding of the average power consumption in the router (APR) can be achieved by dividing it into its buffer (APB) and control (APS) components. This is because the bit transition effect on power consumption at the router control is much smaller than its effect on the power consumption at the router buffer. In regular tile-based architectures, tile dimension is close to the average core dimension, and the core inputs/outputs are placed near the router local channel. Therefore, APC is much smaller than APL and may be safely neglected without significant errors in total power dissipation. Therefore, Equation (2) computes the average router-to-router communication power dissipation, from tile τi to tile τj, where η corresponds to the number of routers through which the packet passes. (2) RRPij = η ×(APB + APS) + (η-1) × APL Considering now an approach with data encoding in the NoC local ports, two new parameters can be introduced to Equation (2): APE and APD (encoder and decoder average power consumption, respectively), producing the Equation (3). (3) CRRPij = APE + η × (APB + APS) + (η - 1) × APL + APD The parameters of the macromodel were acquired after the SPICE simulation of the communication infrastructure and encoding modules with different traffic patterns. Table 2 shows the experimental results obtained by system level simulation within Ptolemy II, using the macromodels described above. The first column describes the type of traffic. The second column reproduces the reduction of transition activity reported by Benini et al. in [7] (when available) and the third column presents the reduction of found on our experiments by reproducing the coding techniques proposed in [5], Both cases report the results in terms of reduction in the number of transitions with respect to the original data streams. The fourth column shows the power consumption (APH) without use of data coding techniques, while the fifth column shows the same measurement when coding techniques are used. Finally, the sixth and seventh columns presents the power consumption overhead due to the encoder and decoder modules (APE + APD) and the number of hops which are needed to amortize this overhead. Experiments with the transmission of synthetically generated streams showed that the use of coding techniques can be advantageous if the average hop count for packages is larger than 3 (so the overhead of encoding and decoding is amortized), or larger than 24 hops for a Java bytecode (power reduction of 1,02 mW/switch). By synthesizing a variety of traffic patterns, we could see that the power savings due to coding range from -1 to 18 mW/switch, thus pointing the direction for further research addressing the use of multiple encoding schemes to better match the transition activity patterns, and the use of NoC topology and routing information to help the decision whether a given stream should be encoded or not. © 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract={Publish-subscribe has become a prevalent paradigm for asynchronous communication in a distributed network. However, existing distributed content-based publish-subscribe systems still have limitations in scalability and adaptability. In this paper, we present a content-based publish-subscribe system over Distributed Hash Table (DHT) based P2P networks. To improve the efficiency of event publication, our approach maps subscriptions and events to rendezvous nodes in terms of a combination of the domain schema identifier and the numbers of attributes in the subscriptions or the events. To impose little overhead on routing substrate, our approach exploits the embedded multicast tree on DHT-based P2P networks for event delivery. The experimental results demonstrate that our system scales well with increasing number of peers and large numbers of subscribers and events. © 2006 IEEE.},

  abstract={This paper makes two contributions to Asynchronous Software Thread Integration (ASTI). First, it presents methods to calculate worst-case secondary thread performance statically. This will enable real-time performance guarantees for the system in future work. Second, it improves the run-time performance of integrated threads by partitioning the register file, allowing faster coroutine calls. Determining the ideal partitioning of the register file is non-trivial if the registers are heterogeneous, which is a common case. We use an exhaustive search to explore the limits of performance possible. We have implemented these analyses in our research compiler Thrint and a shell script to create an automated system for design space exploration. We present experimental results showing the secondary thread performance attainable on an 8-bit embedded microcontroller of the AYR architecture. We automatically integrate two embedded protocols (CAN and MIL-STD-1553B) and two secondary threads (PID controller and serial host interface) and find that in most cases the AVR's 32 registers are adequate for both threads with no slowdown. In two cases slowdowns reach 1.8%, a negligible penalty. Copyright 2005 ACM.},

  abstract={We propose a method for synthesising a set of components from a high-level specification of the intended behaviour of the target system. The designer proceeds via correctness-preserving transformation steps towards an implementable architecture of components which communicate asynchronously. The interface model of each component specifies the communication protocol used. At each step a pre-defined component is extracted and the correctness of the step is proved. This ensures the compatibility of the components. We use Action Systems as our formal approach to system design. The method is inspired by hardware-oriented approaches with their component libraries, but is more general. We also explore the possibility of using tool support to administer the derivation, as well as to assist in correctness proofs. Here we rely on the tools supporting the B Method, as this method is closely related to Action Systems and has good tool support. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract={The popular slogan "write once, run anywhere" effectively renders the expressive capabilities of the JAVA programming framework for developing, deploying, and reusing target-independent applets. Its generality and simplicity has driven most attention of the compiler technology community to developing just-in-time and runtime compilation techniques, local and compositional optimization algorithms. When it comes to real-time JAVA and to the implementation of embedded software, this approach is however far from satisfactory, especially in hard real-time system design (e.g. airborne systems) where conformance to real-time specifications is critical. We show that synchronous design tools, and particularly the design workbench POLYCHRONY, allow for a complete modeling of embedded software written in a high-level and general purpose programming language such as JAVA. The synchronous approach provides a formal engineering model and methodology, using global transformation and optimization techniques, that allow for a JAVA program written once to be mapped on any distributed target architecture. We present a technique to import a resource constrained, multithreaded, RT JAVA program, together with its runtime system API, into POLYCHRONY. We put this modeling technique to work by considering a formal, refinement-based, design methodology that allows for a correct by construction remapping of the initial threading architecture of a given JAVA program on either a single-threaded target or a distributed architecture. This technique allows to generate stand-alone (JVM-less) executables and to remap threads onto a given distributed architecture or a prescribed target real-time operating system. As a result, it allows for a complete separation between the virtual threading architecture of the functional-level system design (in JAVA) and its actual, real-time and resource constrained implementation. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.},

  abstract={The overhead of context-switching limits efficient scheduling of multiple concurrent threads on a uniprocessor when real-time requirements exist. Existing software thread integration (STI) methods reduce context switches, but only provide synchronous thread progress within integrated functions. For the remaining, non-integrated portions of the secondary threads to run and avoid starvation, the primary thread must have adequate amounts of coarse-grain idle time (longer than two context-switches). We have developed asynchronous software thread integration (ASTI) methods which address starvation through the efficient use of coroutine calls and integration. ASTI allows threads to make independent progress efficiently and reduces the number of context switches needed through integration. Software-implemented protocol controllers are crippled by this problem; the primary thread "bit-bangs" each bit of a message onto or off of the bus, leaving only fragments of idle time shorter than a bit time. This fragmented time may be too short to recover through context switching, so only the primary thread can execute during message transmission or reception, slowing the secondary threads and potentially making them miss their deadlines. ASTI simplifies the implementation of embedded communication protocols on low-cost, moderate speed (1 - 100 MHz, 8- and 16-bit) microcontrollers. We demonstrate ASTI by replacing a standard automotive communication protocol controller (J1850) with software and generic hardware. Secondary thread performance improves significantly when compared with a traditional interrupt-based software approach.},

  abstract={In this paper, we present a new compositional verification methodology for efficiently verifying high-assurance properties such as reachability and deadlock freedom of real-time systems. In this methodology, each component of real-time systems is Initially specified as a timed automaton and it communicates with other components via synchronous and/or asynchronous communication channels. Then, each component Is analyzed by a generation of its state-space graph which is formalized as a new state-space representation model called Multiset Labeled Transition Systems (MLTSs). Afterward, the state spaces of the components are hierarchically composed and simplified through a composition algorithm and a set of condensation rules, respectively, to get a condensed state space of the system. The simplified state spaces preserve equivalence with respect to deadlock and reachable states. Such equivalence is assured by our reduction theories called IOT-failure equivalence and IOT-state equivalence. To show the performance of our methodology, we developed a verification tool RT-IOTA and carried out experiments on some benchmarks such as CSMA/CD protocol, a rail-road crossing, an alternating bit-protocol, etc. Specifically, we look at the time taken to generate the state-space, the size of the state space, and the amount of reduction achieved by our condensation rules. The results demonstrate the strength of our new technique in dealing with the state-explosion problem.},

  abstract={Asynchronous communication mechanisms permit the implementation of data interfaces between heterogeneously timed (hets) entities at various hardware levels. Het-based systems provide for flexible interfaces between elements with self-motivated and reactive timing. This flexibility could facilitate large-scale integration without resorting to higher-level manipulations of time through techniques such as those found in traditional networks.},

  abstract={Globally Asynchronous Locally Synchronous (GALS) systems are popular both in software and hardware for specifying and producing embedded systems as well as electronic circuits. In this paper, we propose a method for obtaining automatically a GALS system from a centralised synchronous circuit. We focus on an algorithm that takes as input a program whose control structure is a synchronous sequential circuit and some distribution specifications given by the user, and gives as output the distributed program matching the distribution specifications. Since the obtained programs communicate with each other through asynchronous FIFO queues, the resulting distributed system is indeed a GALS system. We also sketch a correctness proof for our distribution algorithm, and we present how our method can be used to achieve hardware/ software codesign. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.},

First, we define a modal logic for localities that embeds the local theories of each component into a theory of the distributed states of the system. We provide the logic with a sound and complete axiomatization. Then, we extend the logic with a temporal operator. The contribution is that it is possible to reason about properties that involve several components in a natural way, even in the absence of a global clock, as required in an asynchronous setting. © 2002 IEEE.},

  abstract={This paper describes a timed process algebra called TPAP. The aim of this algebra is to allow the modelisation of real time embedded processes sharing common resources, and which are sensitive to communication delays and scheduling strategies. Timed broadcasting and process preemption by interruption events are the two main fundamental notions of the algebra. They allow description of schedulers and asynchronous communication mediums, thus which can be taken into account when verifying the real time behaviour of the global system. We first present the process algebra and discuss its properties. A case study from the avionics area is then developed using TPAP, and formally verified by translation into the UPPAAL model checker. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract={Design tools for embedded reactive systems commonly use a model of computation that employs both synchronous and asynchronous communication styles. We form a junction between these two with an implementation of synchronous languages and circuits (Esterel) on asynchronous networks (POLIS). We implement fact propagation, the key concept of synchronous constructive semantics, on an asynchronous non-deterministic network: POLIS nodes (CFSMs) save state locally to deduce facts, and the network globally propagates facts between them. The result is a correct implementation of the synchronous input/output behavior of the program. Our model is compositional, and thus permits implementations at various levels of granularity from one CFSM per circuit gate to one CFSM per circuit. This allows one to explore various tradeoffs between synchronous and asynchronous implementations.},

  abstract={The synchronous model of concurrency has demonstrated its practicality for the design of circuits, embedded systems, reactive and distributed systems. This model allows to design systems around an idealized notion of deterministic concurrency, which is much easier to deal with than classical, nondeterministic, asynchronous concurrency. Compiling, optimizing, and verifying programs are done using powerful techniques. We take advantage of this rich background by presenting a translation of UML state-machines into a pivot synchronous calculus, based on mathematical notions of pre-orders, in the aim of providing an integrated development cycle for the reliable deployment of synchronous system specifications over asynchronous networks. In this paper we first present the structure of UML state-machines. Compared with earlier studies on that matter the structure under consideration supports, e.g., composite transition and history. Then, we give a brief presentation of the pivot formalism, BDL, which is used to finally give a formal semantics of UML state-machines in terms of pre-ordered transition systems. © 2000 IEEE.},

  abstract={The specification of an embedded system at system level together with co-joint hardware/software synthesis is a goal of many rapid prototyping projects. SDL has been proposed as a formal and abstract specification language well suited for this purpose. The implementation, of SDL's asynchronous communication model in application specific hardware, however, is unproportionally expensive in terms of area and response time. This paper discusses the efficiency of the server model-the implementation model used in all known codesign approaches based on SDL-and compares it with an alternative implementation model for SDL known from software, the activity thread model. In a combination of both implementation strategies, the communication and synchronization overhead for each application can be minimized, and an efficient implementation on distributed architectures realized. The integration in an existing rapid prototyping design process is presented as well as results gained from application examples. © 2000 IEEE.},

SDL has been proposed as a formal and abstract specification language well suited for this purpose. In the automated generation of hardware however, SDL's asynchronous communication model (directly implemented in the so called server model) can lead to a large overhead in area and response time. The activity thread implementation model on the other hand is more similar to hardware description language concepts, respectively an execution in hardware, due to its synchronous communication and execution scheme. This paper compares VHDL code generation from SDL using these two models regarding implementation architectures, resource usage, throughput and response time.

The key feature of SPLICE is asynchronous communication between processes. The characteristics of systems built with SPLICE include dynamic data distribution, fault-tolerance, and real-time performance. This paper presents a formal model to reason about the behaviour of SPLICE systems and to support the design process in system development. SPLICE is formalized using a process algebra called SPLICE Process Algebra. This process algebra allows the derivation of properties of the SPLICE architecture. From these properties a set of guidelines can be produced that aid in the development of SPLICE applications.},

  abstract={This paper presents our experience using the formal description technique Estelle for the protocol development cycle in the area of real-time industrial communication systems. As a real world application the PROFIBUS parts FMS and DP of the European fieldbus standard were completely implemented using formal models. These implementations are successfully used in industrial applications and embedded systems. Our development method, results, and experiences during the development process are discussed in the paper. A closed, tool based method is the overall aim concerning the development life cycle to support the requirement definition as well as the implementation of the product code with final testing. To meet these needs, our approach defines some assumptions and constraints using the syntactic and semantic model of the specification language Estelle, aspects of the modelling process concerning the architecture, handling data abstraction and encapsulation of the specification language vs. real-time data flow in the product code implementation, synchronous vs. asynchronous communications to local interfaces (e.g. physical layer or partly data link layer ASIC) and dealing with special local events like timeoutsr and interrupts in the specification and in the real-time execution environment. The paper discusses advantages and also critical points using the formal way of the protocol development cycle. In theory, it is quite clear that formal description techniques enhance quality. Therefore, we discuss this approach under the user's point of view.},

  abstract={The IoT (Internet of Things) is a network of physical devices (i.e. objects like Vehicles, Machines, Buildings, Furniture, and so on) that helps achieve better service and value. Large amounts of data is generated while connecting these devices and communicating between them. Faster capturing, processing and forwarding of this data certainly requires an efficient technique during each stage of communication. The Publish/Subscribe communication paradigm is a powerful medium for IoT devices to connect and communicate with each other. It offers anonymous, many-to-many and asynchronous communication which plays a very significant role in designing highly scalable distributed systems. Event matching is one of the key aspects of Publish/Subscribe paradigm where an event that has occurred is matched against the large volume of subscriptions to find the appropriate subscribers that need to be notified. The existing event matching solutions are based on the assumption that an assignment (group of events) will be generated and matched against a large number of subscriptions. In the real world, events do not get generated together and hence considering them as an assignment is not the best way to handle them. We are proposing a solution based on the temporal, causal and spatial properties of events, which overcomes the assumption of assignment generation. Our proposed solution, MP-Index (Multi-Predicate Index) allows the Publish/Subscribe system to match individual events occurring at different timestamps against a large volume of subscriptions. The proposed solution was implemented and its results were compared with two of the existing algorithms. The results of the comparison show that the proposed Multi-Predicate Index algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms in terms of matching time. We have also implemented the proposed solution in Mosquitto which is an open source implementation of the MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. The result of this implementation clearly confirms the support for multi-predicate subscription match against events occurring at different time stamps.},

In this article, we consider a new architecture of digital twin (DT) empowered Industrial IoT, where DTs capture the characteristics of industrial devices to assist federated learning. Noticing that DTs may bring estimation deviations from the actual value of device state, a trusted-based aggregation is proposed in federated learning to alleviate the effects of such deviation. We adaptively adjust the aggregation frequency of federated learning based on Lyapunov dynamic deficit queue and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), to improve the learning performance under the resource constraints. To further adapt to the heterogeneity of industrial IoT, a clustering-based asynchronous federated learning framework is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed framework is superior to the benchmark in terms of learning accuracy, convergence, and energy saving.},

  abstract={As Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) has become increasingly important for modern AI applications, federated learning (FL) is envisioned to be the enabling technology for AIoT, especially for large-scale, data privacy-preserving scenarios. However, most existing FL is managed in a centralized manner (CFL), which confronts the limitations of scalability given the AioT device explosion. The key challenge faced by CFL is the communication bottleneck at the central model aggregation server, which leads to a high server-to-worker communication delay and thus severely slows down the model convergence. To address this challenge, this article introduces a generic decentralized FL (DFL) framework that can operate in either synchronous (Sync-DFL) mode or asynchronous (Async-DFL) mode to alleviate the high communication congestion around the central server. Moreover, Async-DFL is the first DFL in the literature to provide a generic FL framework that is fully asynchronous and able to completely avoid worker waiting, which leads to robust distributed model training in the inherently heterogeneous IoT environments, where stragglers (i.e., slow devices) are very common due to the largely varying computing/networking speeds of IoT devices. Our DFL framework is implemented, deployed, and experimented with in both simulation and physical testbeds. The results show that Async-DFL can accelerate the convergence speed of model training twice as fast as CFL, while maintaining convergence accuracy and effectively combating the impact of the stragglers.},

This paper presents a design methodology based on an abstract middleware environment that allows to abstract even the services provided. This is gained by allowing the designer to smoothly move across different design paradigms. As a proof, the paper shows how to mix and exchange applications between tuple-space and message-oriented based middleware environments.},

The latter focuses on letting the component deployment configuration adapt itself when the resources in the environment change due to device mobility. Both techniques are solved using a single mechanism that is based on an extended version of collaborative reinforcement learning (CRL) in the design of our component deployment framework. In order to find local optimal solutions for deploying a component-based application in a distributed resource constrained environment, the CRL method balances the resource consumption of components on several nodes that are in each other's proximity},

  abstract={This paper presents the architecture and design of a high-performance asynchronous Huffman decoder for compressed-code embedded processors. In such processors, embedded programs are stored in compressed form in instruction ROM then are decompressed on demand during instruction cache refill. The Huffman decoder is used as a code decompression engine. The circuit is non-pipelined, and is implemented as an iterative self-timed ring. It achieves a high-speed decode rate with very low area overhead. Simulations using Lsim show an average throughput of 32 bits/25 ns on the output side (or 163 MBytes/sec, or 1303 Mbit/sec), corresponding to about 889 Mbit/sec on the input side. The area of the design is extremely small: under 1 mm/sup 2/ in a 0.8 micron full-custom layout. The decoder is estimated to have higher throughput than any comparable synchronous Huffman decoder (after normalizing for feature size and voltage), yet is much smaller than synchronous designs. Its performance is also 83% faster than a recently published asynchronous Huffman decoder using the same technology.},

  abstract={Asynchronous quasi-delay-insensitive (QDI) circuits are known for their potentially enhanced robustness to PVT variations when compared to synchronous circuits or to bundled data asynchronous design. They are also a good choice for high performance circuits used to solve several real-world problems. However, it is often difficult to constrain the minimum performance for QDI circuits. Thus, enhancing the synthesis quality for QDI design is a justifiable effort, especially in rising application fields, such as the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. This work proposes Pulsar, a method based on the extension of SDDS-NCL, a previously proposed asynchronous QDI template and design flow. Pulsar brings four original contributions: (i) two new models for components used to as sequential barriers; (ii) a new model for half buffer pipelines, half-buffer channel network (HBCN); (iii) a linear programming formulation to define a circuit cycle time constraint; (iv) a design flow that enables automating the process to design sequential SDDS-NCL circuits. Experiments comparing synthesis results with Pulsar of a 6-stage, multiply-accumulate (MAC) show that it can guarantee a maximum cycle time of 3.2ns, while the original Uncle-synthesised circuit without logic optimisation leads to timing violations at a 6ns constraint.},

  abstract={Self-timed circuits appear today as an attractive solution for designing robust and low-power chips dedicated to smart sensing and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. However, a massive adoption of this technology by the industry requires industrial-grade tools for the whole design flow. The gap between asynchronous bundled-data and synchronous circuits is sufficiently tight to exploit the existing commercial tools without impacting the design flow and the time-to-market. This paper especially addresses the timing analysis of asynchronous bundled-data circuits with standard EDA tools and presents a method for exhaustively defining and verifying their relative timing constraints. This new approach only uses a combination of clocks to describe every possible event propagation path, allowing the tools to fully capture the relative timing constraints. Moreover, this can be adapted to different controller implementations and fully automated. A case-study, based on a 128-bit AES implemented in UMC 55nm uLP technology, illustrates the proposed methodology and evaluates its efficiency in terms of complexity and execution time.},

  abstract={Various global development opportunities have been escalated through the Internet of Everything (IoE) with the potential of progressing Sustainable Development goals - dramatically accelerating and improving lives of millions. The emerging economies of developing countries with minimal investments have crafted a huge array of (IoE) technologies strongly demanding interoperability and interconnectivity that are affordable, scalable and available, significantly improving people's quality of life. Growing number of devices requiring interconnectivity referring to the concept of (IoE) headed beyond sensors, chips, computers and smartphones. The modern replete technology has enabled both synchronous and asynchronous communication without human interaction in many industrial processes, fleet management, stock exchanges, inventory systems and environment monitoring regardless of their extensive deployment. Information Communication Technology (ICT) is a fast evolving industry in developing countries, offering (IoE)'s huge potential of transformation and disruption. The global development challenges have emphasised the need for communication and due to (IoE) advancements, long-standing issues (health care, stock, management, cross-border, technology diffusion etc.) would be surmounted in an affordable and quick manner. The developing countries would turn-around with the help of a long-awaited (IoE) technology aiming at improving their economies and lives of millions of people. The key to increased usage is the interconnectedness of diverse range of devices which formerly were incompatible with each other. The interoperability between devices has rendered (IoE) both practical and possible and in accordance with the international communication standards. Research and industrial organisations have stipulated the formation of a hyper-connected society where tens of billions daily life objects and devices would communicate, forming a global network of smart devices. The successful provision of intelligent and smart devices through (IoE) services leads to challenging security concerns especially in developing countries where communication and devices are cheap but there is a lack of secure (IoE) infrastructures. The current paper would envisage a secure architecture for diversely connected objects within developing countries. A secure configuration methodology of the bootstrapping scheme is proposed as a solution in this paper. The bootstrapping scheme is activated as soon as a new object get connected to an operational network. This method is feasible to secure the devices and avoid data exploitation within developing countries where communication across devices is still lacking protected infrastructures. A review of the Internet of Everything (IoE) is represented beneath, along with a brief portrayal of the applications and difficulties confronted by the (IoE).},

This architecture is based on a data synchronized control scheme that is well adapted to the implementation of numerous telecommunication applications specified, with a data flow model. The template architecture permits an easy integration of HW and SW coarse grain units. Communications between internal units are assumed to have an asynchronous protocol that is the more general transfer mechanism but also the more expensive in hardware resources. Hence, a communication synthesis method is presented that transforms asynchronous communications into synchronous ones. Results on an acoustic echo canceller illustrate the interest of the approach.},

By optimizing the organiztion of signal data, exploiting the memory hierairchy, and associating the stream to different operations, we efficiently overlap kernel execution and data transfer. Our results indicate a significant performance improvement over GPU-based and CPU-based FFT algorithms. The speedup is 18 percent higher than the original GPU-based on average.},

  abstract={This work addresses the problem of application mapping in networks-on-chip (NoCs). It explores the importance of characterizing network traffic to effectively predict NoC energy consumption. Traffic is seen as an important factor affecting the problem of mapping applications into NoCs having as goal to minimize the total dynamic energy consumption of a complex system-on-a-chip (SoC). Experiments showed that failing to consider the bit transitions influence on traffic inevitably leads to an energy estimation error. This error is proportional to the amount of bit transitions in transmitted packets. In applications that present a large number of packets exchange, the error is propagated, significantly affecting the mapping results. This paper proposes a high-level application model that captures the traffic effect and uses it to describe the behavior of applications. In order to evaluate the quality of the proposed model, a set of embedded systems were described using both, a previously proposed model (that does not capture the traffic effect), and the model proposed here. Comparing the resulting mappings, those derived from the proposed model showed improvements in energy savings with regard to the other model for all experiments.},

  abstract={In the 20th century, an embedded system was most often thought of as a single piece of equipment driven by a single software program. Many efficient modeling, programming and verification paradigms have been developed in this setting: mathematical modeling using differential equations, reactive and synchronous programming, data-flow based signal processing, model-checking, etc. In the 21st century, systems are becoming much more complex. They mix hardware and software in subtle ways, involve a large number of sensors and actuators, become physically distributed, and may be remotely controlled by Web-based devices such as smartphones. Designing and verifying such systems raises many challenges that were independently known in particular areas but now need to be solved together. Here are some: understanding the relation between continuous and discrete time models, still quite unclear in the available mathematical modelers; understanding the ways in which synchronous and asynchronous communication could work in harmony; relaxing determinacy and timing constraints without losing too much predictability; being able to write full and faithful simulators of systems before building them, which is still a big problem in areas such as SoCs or transportation networks; developing methods to couple classical embedded systems with Web-based systems, which are of a very different nature. We will review some of the new problems posed in this area and some emerging solutions that could be applied to them, taking the notion of causality as the pivot of our reflections.},

It splits the data-parallel function presented by low-level intermediate representation into several parts by simulating synchronization. We evaluate our method in translating PTX kernels to multi-core CPUs, the result of which shows this method could promotes performance by 15% compared to thread-based method.

  abstract={Localization has emerged as an attractive solution to enable new business models that rely on location-based services in wireless networks for communication, sensing, and control. In particular, time difference-of-arrival (TDOA) is one of the widely used localization models. However, the conventional TDOA requires precise time synchronization between a target node and anchor nodes for measuring the time difference, which leads to a large number of packets for communication. To reduce packet transmission, we propose a model for measuring the time difference without time synchronization called ASync-TDOA. Different from the conventional model, ASync-TDOA can measure the time difference in a one-way-based ranging by introducing the reference node. Specifically, the time difference between the target node and anchor nodes can be directly measured by the server based on the timestamps from the reference node. After that, the target node is accurately located using least squares and brute force for the time difference. We implement the ASync-TDOA model on a localization system with ultra-wideband signals to estimate the localization of the target node, which is easy to operate in practical engineering. The experiments show that the proposed ASync-TDOA is efficient in reducing the packet transmissions and improving the TDOA measurement and localization precision.},

Smart-M3 is an open-source platform that implements the smart space concept.

A SmartM3 semantic information broker (SIB) maintains the smart space in low-level ontological terms of triples. Smart Space Access Protocol (SSAP) is used for session management and triple governance transactions. This paper considers the session between KP and SIB in the Smart-M3 applications. First, SSAP session will be studied. Second, a new SmartSlog session scheme will be introduced. It operates with such ontological concepts as a class, a property, and an individual and extends the capabilities of SSAP session. New session scheme is based on SSAP session and can manipulates with many SSAP sessions by combining them in one session. All data are shared between SSAP sessions and it allows to work with different smart spaces as with one on KP side. The new session scheme is partially implemented in SmartSlog ontology library.},

  abstract={Generators are a natural fit for expressing concurrency. In dynamic languages such as Icon and Unicon where every expression is a generator that produces a sequence of values until it fails, there is a pervasive opportunity for exploiting concurrency. In this paper we present a simple model of explicit concurrency for generators based on co-expressions and multithreaded generator proxies, called pipes. Co-expressions are coroutines that shadow the environment to prevent interference, while pipes are generator proxies that communicate with the original expression running in a separate thread using blocking queues. Together these two mechanisms are sufficient to express both interleaving as well as true concurrency in the form of parallel pipelining, and to build higher-order abstractions such as map-reduce. We then present techniques for embedding concurrent generators into Java using transformation. We introduce a form of annotations for mixed-language embedding, called scoped annotations, that allow mixing in functionality at the level of expressions, methods, or classes. Transformations over the annotated regions then unravel the syntax of generator expressions to a conventional form by flattening nested generators in order to enable native evaluation and seamless interoperability. Mixed-language embedding allows using the succinct notation of concurrent generators within a familiar object-oriented setting, and enables their use for high-level coordination as well as the prototyping and refinement of parallel programs for multi-core architectures.},

Our experiments on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller evaluate the time and memory costs of coroutines in comparison with alternatives, and we show that context switching with coroutines is significantly faster than with thread-based real-time operating systems. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of these language features on prototypical Internet of Things sensor software. We find that the proposed language enhancements potentially bring significant benefits to programming in C++ for embedded computers, but that the implementation imposes constraints that may prevent its widespread acceptance among the embedded development community.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is based on a wireless network that connects a huge number of smart objects, products, smart devices, and people. It has another name which is Web of Things (WoT). IoT uses standards and protocols that are proposed by different standardization organizations in message passing within session layer. Most of the IoT applications protocols use TCP or UDP for transport. XMPP, CoAP, DDS, MQTT, and AMQP are grouped of the widely used application protocols. Each one of these protocols have specific functions and are used in specific way to handle some issues. This paper provides an overview for one of the most popular application layer protocols that is MQTT, including its architecture, message format, MQTT scope, and Quality of Service (QoS) for the MQTT levels. MQTT works mainly as a pipe for binary data and provides a flexibility in communication patterns. It is designed to provide a publish-subscribe messaging protocol with most possible minimal bandwidth requirements. MQTT uses Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) for transport. MQTT is an open standard, giving a mechanisms to asynchronous communication, have a range of implementations, and it is working on IP.},

  abstract={Remote attestation has emerged as a valuable security mechanism which aims to verify remotely whether or not a potentially untrusted device has been compromised. The protocols of Remote attestation are particularly important for securing Internet of Things (IoT) systems which, due to the large number of interconnected devices and limited security protections, are susceptible to a wide variety of cyber attacks. To guarantee the integrity of a software running on a single device, remote attestation is usually executed as an uninterrupted procedure: at the attestation time, a device stops the normal operation and executes the attestation of the entire device without interruption. The remote attestation protocols that aim to attest a large number of devices also follow the assumption on uninterrupted execution: when a device attests its network neighbours, each device verified in the neighborhood suspends its normal operation until the attestation protocol is completed. To avoid unnecessary suspension of the normal operation of the devices, this paper proposes a novel Secure Asynchronous Remote Attestation (SARA) protocol that releases the constraint of synchronous interaction among devices. In particular, SARA is an attestation protocol that exploits asynchronous communication capabilities among IoT devices in order to attest a distributed IoT service executed by them. SARA verifies both that each IoT device is not compromised (device trustworthiness), and that the exchanged communication data have not maliciously influence the communicating devices (legitimate operations). By tracing the execution order of each service invocation of an asynchronous distributed service, SARA allows each service to collect accurately historical data of its interactions, and transmits asynchronously such historical data to other interacting services. We have implemented and validated SARA through a realistic simulation on the Contiki emulator that demonstrates the functionality and efficiency of our protocol. The results confirm the suitability of SARA for low-end devices.},

  abstract={Featured Application        Sensor data record-based dynamic encryption key technology which applies the mechanism of blockchain for security between devices in the low-power wireless communication environment of Internet of Things (IoT).        The Internet of Things uses low-power wireless communication for wireless connectivity and efficient energy. Low-power wireless communication is applied to IoT for wireless connection and efficient energy consumption in various areas such as wearable devices, smart homes, and power plants in order to send and receive data and control the environment. Security is becoming more important because the Internet of Things controls real physical systems. For the security of the Internet of Things, the encryption key is important to identify and authenticate devices that are trusted. The static encryption key method used for devices is likely to be calculated in reverse through the value of the key and is vulnerable to exploitation attacks. This requires the application of dynamic encryption keys that generate keys periodically. However, in the case of low-power wireless communication, the asynchronous communication method and the packet loss make it difficult to apply existing dynamic encryption key technologies. In this paper, we proposed dynamic encryption key method that applies the mechanism of the block chain to solve these problems. Based on the history of sensor data between devices, encryption keys are dynamically generated. The proposed method is to generate the same encryption key between devices with only one step of asynchronous communication considering packet loss. The proposed method is also validated in terms of availability and security in the Internet of Things low-power wireless communication.},

  abstract={One of the biggest implementation challenges in security-critical network protocols is nested state machines. In practice today, state machines are either implemented manually at a low level, risking bugs easily missed in audits; or are written using higher-level abstractions like threads, depending on runtime systems that may sacrifice performance or compatibility with the ABIs of important platforms (e.g., resource-constrained IoT systems). We present a compiler-based technique allowing the best of both worlds, coding protocols in a natural high-level form, using freer monads to represent nested coroutines, which are then compiled automatically to lower-level code with explicit state. In fact, our compiler is implemented as a tactic in the Coq proof assistant, structuring compilation as search for an equivalence proof for source and target programs. As such, it is straightforwardly (and soundly) extensible with new hints, for instance regarding new data structures that may be used for efficient lookup of coroutines. As a case study, we implemented a core of TLS sufficient for use with popular Web browsers, and our experiments show that the extracted Haskell code achieves reasonable performance.},

However, the harsh constraints in IoT make executing collaborative learning much more difficult than well-connected systems composed by servers with strong computation power, due to the weak capacity of devices, limited bandwidth for exchanging information, the asynchronous communication environment, and the necessity of privacy preserving. We show that even if with the harsh constraints in IoT, it still can devise efficient privacy-preserving collaborative learning algorithms, by proposing the first known decentralized collaborative learning algorithm for the fundamental multiarmed bandits problem under the framework of local differential privacy. Rigorous analysis shows that the proposed learning algorithm can make every agent learn the best arm with a high probability and keep the privacy preserved meanwhile. Extensive experiments illustrate that our learning algorithm performs well in real settings.},

The hierarchy modeling method satisfies software and hardware reuse, which can reduce lots of repetitive work, improve the efficency, save the costs of production and shorten the period for developing embedded system.

Though defining some components, designers can modeling synchronous and asynchronous communication, event-triggered and time-triggered interaction, distributed and parallel execution, Client/Server and blackboard architecture, etc. In this method, there are three kinds of component models including atomic components' behavior Embedded systems can be defined as information models characterized by finite state machines, processing systems embedded into these enclosing inter-components' interaction models described by composition operators and priority models represented by strict partial order. According to this methodology, an embedded system can be decomposed into many subsystems, which become the biggest independent components and interact with each other through a series of interaction ports. These components can easily be constructed by a set of smaller components and connectors till they are undividable and composed of atomic components characterized by a set of actions and the associated behavior Then, they are composed into a whole system model and the simulation is available. After testing, its performance can be evaluated and be used to determine whether that virtual system can be accomplished accurately and suffices for the given functional and non-functional requirements, or, software code and HDL code can be created automatically for designing an actual product.},

  abstract={To increase railway use efficiency, the European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS) Level 3 requires all trains to constantly and reliably self-monitor and report their integrity and track position without infrastructure support. Timely train separation detection is challenging, especially for long freight trains without electrical power on cars. Data fusion of multiple monitoring techniques is currently investigated, including distributed integrity sensing of all train couplings. We propose a wireless sensor network (WSN) topology, communication protocol, application, and sensor nodes prototypes designed for low-power timely train integrity (TI) reporting in unreliable conditions, like intermittent node operation and network association (e.g., in low environmental energy harvesting conditions) and unreliable radio links. Each train coupling is redundantly monitored by four sensors, which can help to satisfy the train collision avoidance system (TCAS) and European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) software integrity level (SIL) 4 requirements and contribute to the reliability of the asynchronous network with low rejoin overhead. A control center on the locomotive controls the WSN and receives the reports, helping the integration in railway or Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. Software simulations of the embedded application code virtually unchanged show that the energy-optimized configurations check a 50-car TI (about 1-km long) in 3.6-s average with 0.1-s standard deviation and that more than 95% of the reports are delivered successfully with up to one-third of communications or up to 15% of the nodes failed.

Decentralized optimization to solve this problem has been a significant focus within engineering research due to its advantages in scalability, robustness, and flexibility. Most existing methods are synchronous while few works are devoted to asynchronously solving the problem. The problem becomes even more challenging when the networks are directed. To address the resource allocation problem when the above issues are considered, we propose a novel decentralized asynchronous algorithm based on the gossip-based communication protocol and epigraph strategy. An important feature of the algorithm is that it is implemented in a completely decentralized manner in the case of asynchronous communication and directed networks. We provide theoretical proof to guarantee the convergence of the proposed algorithm, which indicates that it can successfully allocate the optimal resource. When solving the resource allocation problem over time-varying directed networks, we further discuss a related decentralized asynchronous algorithm according to the random sleep protocol. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the viability and performance of the algorithms.},

  abstract={Identity is a crucial property of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Due to rapid growth and high numbers of similar devices, reliable identification of those devices is a problem. The origin and history of an IoT device is especially important in security-relevant environments.        Our research addresses this issue by proposing an approach based on blockchain and decentralised identifiers (DID). It is inspired by the concepts of self-sovereign identity (SSI) and bootstrapping of remote secure key infrastructures (BRSKI). Devices are equipped by the manufacturer with an identity stored in a trusted execution environment (TEE) and secured by a blockchain. This identity can be used to trace back the origin of the device. During the bootstrapping process on the customer side, the identity registration of the device is updated in the blockchain. This process is performed by a so-called registrar. Smart contracts prevent unsolicited transfer of ownership and track the history of the device. Besides proof of origin and device security our concept can be used for device inventory and firmware upgrade.        A prototype implementation was realised to validate the concept. All six use cases have been implemented and tested using an Ethereum blockchain infrastructure. JSON Web Tokens (JWT) have been used as signed artefacts to transfer information between the stakeholders. This enables an asynchronous communication needed for example in an environment with no direct internet access. Such an infrastructure can be provided by an independent association and can be used by all manufacturers. Depending on the environment a registration of devices can be optional or mandatory.},

  abstract={In the past few years, the development of Internet of Things (IoT) has demonstrated a great convenience for human beings' lives. A well-defined IoT communication protocol assists data transmitted on IoT in a secure and efficient way. The LoRaWAN developed by the LoRa Alliance employs asynchronous communication and three communication modes to control its energy consumption, and utilizes the AES cryptology and two session keys to enhance its communication security. However, the AES encryption process consumes much energy, and the session key also lacks of simple update procedure. To reduce the energy consumed by AES and enhance communication security, in this paper, we design an energy-efficient AES encryption method, named Energy Efficient Data Encryption (E2DE for short) which adopts three low energy design techniques and a simple key update procedure. Simulation is performed by using Synopsys 32 nm cell library with 5 different supply voltages. Experimental results show that average 46.1% energy is reduced when compared to the traditional AES data encryption method. Besides, the session key update procedure can achieve mutual authentication and resist replay and eavesdropping attacks.},

  abstract={Encryption in field-programmable gate array (FPGA) often provides a good security solution to protect data privacy in Internet-of-Things systems, but this security solution can be compromised by side-channel attacks (SCAs). In this article, we present an FPGA-based dual-hiding asynchronous-logic (async-logic) advanced encryption standard (AES) accelerator, which is highly resistant against SCAs and yet low area/energy overheads. The proposed AES accelerator achieves vertical (amplitude) SCA hiding via an area-efficient dual-rail mapping approach and a zero-value (ZV) compensated substitution-box (S-Box), while enhancing the horizontal (temporal) SCA hiding of async-logic operations via a timing-boundary-free input arrivaltime randomizer and a skewed-delay controller. A comprehensive SCA evaluation is performed with 11 SCA models, and we show that our proposed design can offer a strong SCA resistance with measurement-to-disclosure (MTD) of >20 million traces. To our best knowledge, our design is the most secure AES design evaluated with the largest number of traces in FPGA. To compare the design overheads for security, we quantify the figure of merit as normalized (Area x Energy/MTD(All) x 10(6)). The figure of merit of our proposed design is 403x smaller than the benchmark dual-rail synchronous-logic design and 95x smaller than a reported async-logic design.},

  abstract={CNN is a popular deep learning structure able to provide intelligent processing in IoT applications. Instead of deploying the resource-hungry CNN inference workloads on the cloud, it would be promising to utilize local IoT devices for the in-situ processing. Since a single IoT device has only limited resources available, distributing over multiple local devices becomes a potential solution, especially for high-accuracy and time-sensitive tasks. However, it is non-trivial to distribute the inference of existing CNN models efficiently as they are inherently tightly-coupled structure.        In this paper, we propose a distributed in-situ CNN inference system with the loosely-coupled CNN structure (LCS), the synchronization-oriented partitioning (SOP), and the decentralized asynchronous communication (DAC) for IoT applications. LCS is based on two novel design ideas, the homogeneous group and the intermittent shuffle. Experiments on ImageNet classification illustrate that LCS has the leading accuracy compared with other structures, under a given computation budget. SOP and DAC target on converting the loosely-coupled feature of LCS into practical performance improvement. SOP tries to partition LCS with fewer synchronization points and DAC reduces the communication overhead by overlapping communications. When the number of IoT devices increases from 1 to 4, our system accelerates by up to 3.85x, and reduces the memory footprint in each device by 70%, outperforming other approaches.},

  abstract={A joint algorithm-architecture study has resulted into a new version of a picture segmentation system complying with multimedia mobile terminal constraints, i.e., real-time computing, and low power consumption. Previously published watershed segmentation algorithms required at least three global synchronization points: minima detection, labeling and flooding. This paper presents a new fully asynchronous algorithm, where pixels can compute their local data in parallel and independently from one another, and which requires only a unique final global synchronization point. This paper provides a formal demonstration of the convergence and correctness of this new parallel asynchronous algorithm using a mathematical model of data propagation in a graph: the associative net formalism. We demonstrate the simplicity of implementation of this algorithm on parallel processor arrays. We explore, simulate, and validate several configurations of the algorithm-architecture using a "SystemC" model. Simulations reveal an image segmentation rate up to 66,000 QCIF images/sec, i.e., a speed-up factor of more than 1,000 times compared with state of the art watershed algorithms. A fine grain processor array design using ST microelectronics 0.18 mu m CMOS technology confirms that this new approach is a breakthrough in the domain of real-time image segmentation.},

UPDI provides microcontrollers programming and debugging via a bi-directional half-duplex asynchronous communication using a single-wire interface. This paper proposes an IoT Microchip AVR programmer which supports UPDI using Wi-Fi and LoRa technologies. It provides over-the-air firmware updating to the supported families of microcontrollers.

According to the use scenario of the gateway and the connectivity of the equipment, the hardware architecture, hardware interfaces, functionality, and performance of the gateway were briefly designed, so as to monitor patients with hyperthyroidism more comprehensively and save labor costs. The gateway can provide access to different devices and adaptation functions to different hardware interfaces and provide hardware support for the subsequent deployment of the proposed new medical communication protocols and related information systems. A medical data convergence information system based on multidevice management and multiprotocol parsing was designed and implemented. The system enables the management and configuration of different medical devices and access to data through the targeted parsing of the underlying medical device communication protocols. The system also provides the automatic adaptation of multiple types of underlying medical device communication protocols and automatic parsing of multiple versions and can provide multiple devices to process fused data streams or device information and data from a single device. The use of event-driven asynchronous communication eliminates the tight dependency on service invocation in the synchronous communication approach. The use of a metadata-based data model structure enables model extensions to accommodate the impact of iterative business requirements on the database structure. Real-time patient physiological data transmission for intraoperative monitoring based on the MQTT protocol and video transmission for intraoperative patient monitoring based on the RTMP protocol were implemented. The development of the intelligent medical monitoring service system was completed, and the system was tested, optimized, and deployed. The functionality and performance of the system were tested, the performance issue of slow query speed was optimized, and the deployment of the project using Docker containers was automated.},

One of the potential solutions for reducing the cost is to reuse the software developed at previous missions. Virtual machine platform such as JVM is a good example to provide code portability across various missions. Flight software in aerospace field is adopting this concept to improve reusability and eventually to reduce development cost. In this paper, we propose a Lua-based virtualization environment for spacecraft flight software. Flight software for spacecraft control consists of a few tasks that are highly autonomous. Lua is chosen as the script language for programming the control tasks. Though Lua was designed with simplicity and portability, it only supports multithreading with collaborative coroutines. To support preemptive multitasking, we implement time slicing coroutines as spacecraft control processes. New coroutine scheduler is devised and time slicing functionality is added into the scheduler. Scheduler locking and message passing with external flight software are also implemented. Instead of modifying the Lua interpreter, we have exploited the debug support APIs for our implementation. For evaluation, we have implemented the flight software virtualization environment on the flight computer. Accuracy of the time slicing scheduler is also analyzed.},

One of the major drawbacks of LoRa is the data latency and the traffic congestion when the number of devices in the network increases. Especially, the latency arises due to the extreme duty cycling of LoRa end-nodes for reducing the overall energy consumption. To overcome this drawback, we propose a heterogeneous network architecture and an energy-efficient On-demand TDMA communication scheme improving both the device lifetime and the data latency of standard LoRa networks. We combine the capabilities of micro watt wake-up receivers to achieve ultra-low power states and pure asynchronous communication together with the long-range connectivity of LoRa. Experimental results show a data reliability of 100 % and a round-trip latency on the order of milliseconds with end devices dissipating less than 46 mJ when active and 1.83 mu W during periods of inactivity, lasting up to 3 years on a 1200 mA h Lithium battery.},

  abstract={An extensive list of time-sensitive applications requiring ultra-low latency ranging from a few microseconds to a few milliseconds are presented in recent publications and IEEE standards. Time-sensitive applications, include industrial, critical healthcare and transportation applications as also applications for Smart Grids and the Internet of Vehicles -- one of the most active research fields of Intelligent Transportation Systems of Smart Cities. In this work, we mainly set our focus on the suite of safety applications which attracts strong interest from the research community, as it aims to avoid road accidents and save lives.        The IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) set of standards specifies fundamental real-time characteristics. Nevertheless, as TSN works on Data Link layer (Layer 2 of the OSI model) the benefits of these characteristics fade away when other layers are crossed from the Application layer (Layer 7). Indicatively, recent research works report latencies on the order of tens of seconds when benchmarking Data Stream Processing and IoT platforms, and thus they are not suited for time-critical applications. Such platforms mainly use loosely coupled components with asynchronous communication.        On Application layer, we propose a novel End-to-End Synchronous, Distributed Architecture for Large-Scale, High-Bandwidth, Ultra-Low Latency Data Stream Processing. Through our Big Data Stream analysis experiments (4.7 Gbit/s total average aggregated throughput, 1 Terabyte in-memory distributed database, 4 milliseconds average query latency) we have demonstrated the suitability of our architecture for time-sensitive applications such as accident avoidance for the Internet of Vehicles.},

Thus, this work address DT challenges into asynchronous and synchronous requirements. First, this work reviewed the literature best approaches, hardware, and software while implementing a DT. Then, it proposes a high-level architecture over a Petri Net (PN) model to address the async issue. After that, to perform a sync test, it implements a DT prototype using the literature equipment and respecting the architecture proposed. The results show that the case study respects the requirements for safe operation regarding timing and modeling constraints.},

  abstract={Text messaging is an asynchronous communication tool for both utilitarian and entertainment activities. The purpose of this study is to investigate the self-determined motivation of text messaging behaviours through Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Data collected via a web-based survey were used to examine the effects of autonomy, competence and relatedness on self-determined Short Message Service (SMS). Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) revealed that only competency and relatedness increase self-determined SMS, while autonomy affected it negatively. The result implies that the ability to engage in personal communication and the desire to become socially connected are the essence of SMS internal motivation. This study also suggests that higher self-determined information technology usage reduces freedom to disengage from it and that obligated communication becomes another determining factor of usage. Practitioners and researchers can benefit from these findings by incorporating self-determined usage behaviours into work play aspects of modern day ubiquitous computing usage.},

  abstract={Real-time systems in applications like command, control, communications and intelligence require complex distributed systems with many interacting software components, heterogeneous processing systems and sharing resources.  These systems should satisfy not only the functional requirements of application software, but also the specified timing constraints on the execution of the software, despite faults and failures.  In addition, parallelism needs to be expressed in the design of such systems and exploited on the target distributed computing systems.  In this paper, an approach to software design for distributed real-time computing systems, based on the PROOF computation model which integrates object-oriented and functional paradigms, is presented.  To support adaptability of the software system to a predictably changing environment, our approach supports multi-versions of a method definition, synchronous communication within objects, asynchronous communication among objects, encapsulation of timing constraints in objects and expressing parallelism in object-level and method-level.  Our design approach consists of the high-level object-oriented design and object design phases.  Our design approach is illustrated with a hypothetical chemical plant simulation system.

  abstract={Deep neural network (DNN) learns hierarchical representations from big data in a multilayer network structure and has achieved great successes in many fields such as computer vision and speech analysis. Since DNN usually contains several billions of parameters, the asynchronous stochastic gradient descent (ASGD) algorithm is often used to train an effective DNN model on a computer cluster. However, as the increase of computing nodes and data size, ASGD suffers from serious slow convergence deficiency because the parameters might be wrongly updated by long-term delayed gradients. In this paper, we propose a delay compensated asynchronous Adam (DC-Adam) algorithm to train DNN. In particular, DC-Adam updates the parameters with the moment increment which is the division of the first and the second moments to take the advantage of the original Adam algorithm, and compensates the gradient with the first-order component in its Taylor expansion. Since the delay compensation technique reduces the error of delayed gradients, and the moment increment further counteracts the influence of approximated compensation, DC-Adam converges much more rapidly than ASGD on a computer cluster with moderate computing nodes. We theoretically analyze the Ergodic convergence rate of DC-Adam and compare with DC-ASGD. We implement our DC-Adam algorithm on 61 computing nodes in a computer cluster, and conduct image classification by using LeNet and ResNet, respectively, on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that DC-Adam greatly accelerates the training progress and achieves almost linear speedup rate as increasing the computing nodes.},

It is well-known that a tree-based, recursive design approach caters well for scalability requirements. With this observation in mind, the paper develops an approach that permits an auction service to be mapped on to globally distributed auction servers. The paper selects a suitable auction model that treats sellers and buyers symmetrically. This symmetry enables a computational node to play at one level of the tree the role of a seller by dealing with a group of potential buyers as well as to play the role of a potential buyer at the next higher level. Such a symmetric auction (also known as a double auction) is used for supporting a standard auction to be carried out in a hierarchic manner. An architecture is developed and basic algorithms and protocols are presented.},

In particular, the synchronous communication paradigms often employed in standard middleware do not appear to be particularly suited to ad hoc environments, in which not even the intermittent availability of a backbone network can be assumed. Instead, asynchronous communication seems to be a generally more suitable paradigm for such environments. Message oriented middleware for traditional systems has been developed and used to provide an asynchronous paradigm of communication for distributed systems, and, also for some specific mobile computing systems recently. In this paper, we present our experience in designing, implementing, and evaluating Epidemic Messaging Middleware for Ad hoc networks (EMMA), an adaptation of Java Message Service (JMS) for mobile ad hoc environments, discussing in detail the design challenges and the solutions that have been adopted.},

  abstract={Monitoring and supervision of land resources requires several spatial databases related to land use, land planning, mineral resources, etc. It also needs support via information technologies such as GIS, GNSS, RS (3S), wireless communication, and internet-of-things. At present, in view of the requirements related to the complexity and comprehensiveness of the monitoring and supervision of land resources, some application systems have been developed in China and some progress has been made. However, most of the existing systems have several weaknesses; for example, field inspection and office verification have to be carried out separately. Real-time spatial data analysis and monitoring confirmation cannot be performed, and the process is time consuming. A dynamic and integrated monitoring process has not yet been realized. In this study, a new type of land resource monitoring and supervision system (LRMSS) with 3S and mobile internet is designed and developed. The LRMSS integrates real-time data communication and the monitoring and supervision of land resources with spatial analysis. It provides a multilevel, multifaceted visual display of the monitoring processes and graphics and other information on the mobile terminal and monitoring platform. The standardized, efficient, and systematic LRMSS has been implemented and applied, which can improve the processing speed and work efficiency of the monitoring and supervision of land resources. In this study, based on location services, an unattended geospatial analysis and service model is developed by integrating 3S technologies using multisource data; thereafter, the corresponding system software, which provides the functions of integrating the data of the core database of land resources and monitoring of land resources, is developed. Meanwhile, based on the accessing mechanism of geospatial information service with the asynchronous communication protocol, the study uses the VPDN network as the main means and the BDS short message as an emergency supplement. Data security and the transmission mechanism for reliable transmission of geospatial data are both realized. The paper states the interface requirements and data standard for reporting and receiving data between databases. The results of this study can provide services for supervising and decision analysis for law enforcement supervision. It has been widely used in the department of land resource management.},

  abstract={Time synchronisation and localisation should be jointly conducted for time-based source location estimates in an asynchronous network. In this paper semidefinite programming (SDP), complexity-reduced SDP and linear least square (LLS) estimator are proposed for time synchronisation and localisation of multiple source nodes. The proposed algorithms provide joint estimates for the source locations and clock parameters and avoid the shortcoming of maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that requires an initial solution. Then, a location refinement (LR) technique is designed to improve the accuracy performance of the estimated parameters. The simulations show that the original SDP algorithm provides better accuracy performance than the complexity-reduced SDP. However, the complexity-reduced SDP runs faster than the original SDP. Although the complexity of LLS estimator is lowest among three proposed algorithms, the convex optimisation algorithms, including the original SDP and complexity-reduced SDP, have more robust performance compared with the LLS estimator.},

  abstract={Distributed systems are challenging to design properly and prove correctly due to their heterogeneous and distributed nature. These challenges depend on the programming paradigms used and their semantics. The actor paradigm has the advantage of offering a modular semantics, which is useful for compositional design and analysis. Shared variable concurrency and race conditions are avoided by means of asynchronous message passing. The object-oriented paradigm is popular due to its facilities for program structuring and reuse of code. These paradigms have been combined by means of concurrent objects where remote method calls are transmitted by message passing and where low-level synchronization primitives are avoided. Such kinds of objects may exhibit active behavior and are often called active objects. In this setting the concept of futures is central and is used by a number of languages. Futures offer a flexible way of communicating and sharing computation results. However, futures come with a cost, for instance with respect to the underlying implementation support, including garbage collection. In particular this raises a problem for loT systems.        The purpose of this paper is to reconsider and discuss the future mechanism and compare this mechanism to other alternatives, evaluating factors such as expressiveness, efficiency, as well as syntactic and semantic complexity including ease of reasoning. We limit the discussion to the setting of imperative, active objects and explore the various mechanisms and their weaknesses and advantages. A surprising result (at least to the authors) is that the need of futures in this setting seems to be overrated. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.},
